The idea behind the classifier\n\nA decision tree is conceptually the simplest machine learning algorithm, so we will show how machine learning works on it. \n\nMachine learning algorithms can be roughly divided into  *classifocation* algorithms and *clustering* algorithms . A decision tree is a classification algorithm.\n\nClassification generally works like this. We declare one column from the data table as  the **targeted** variable. In our case is the  *end_result* column, but it can be any other column that we are interested in  (that is, for which we want to find out how the values in the other columns  *predicts* it)\n\nLet's raise the first three columns of our table( press *Shift+Enter* on the next cell):",

    {
      "cell_type": "code",

      "execution_count": null,
      "outputs": []
    },
    {
      "cell_type": "markdown",
      "source": "The meaning of the *end_result* is next:\n* Value 0 means \"abandoned cart\"\n* Value 1 means \"unfinished payment\"\n* Value 2 means \"card declined during payment\"\n* Value 3 means \"Successful payment\"\n\nLet's imagine for now these three lines. If our target variable is *end_result*, then it means that we want to predict the value of  *end_result* based on the results in other columns. For example, if we want to predict who abandoned the cart, we see that it is true on these three lines \"If **gender = m**, then **end_result = 2**\".\n\n**gender = m** is called a *predictor* for target variable **end_result** (that is,to recognize when  **end_result = 2**). Notice that **gender = m** is a predictor, while  **gender** itself is called *property* odnosno *feature* \n\nThere can be more predictors, and in this example we see that there are more:\n\n* **gender = m**\n* **age < 28** (also it could have been 24, 25, 26,...,32, but we chose 28 because it is in the middle)\n* **item_id > 250** (again , it can be any value that separates them)\n* Can you find another? (hint: price)\n\nWe also note that predictors can be complex. For example, the predictor **prev_purchases_in_usd = 0 AND uses_whishlist = 1** also works well. This predictor also points to  **end_result = 2**.\n\nAs a small digression, how would we formulate a predictor using the feature **prev_purchases_in_usd = 0** i **uses_whishlist = 1** for **end_result = 2**?\n\nThe answer is **prev_purchases_in_usd > 0 OR uses_whishlist = 0** (notice the changes, AND in OR, and values).\n\nBut let's go back to decision trees. Let's load the following table row:",

      "source": "In theory, we could manually construct the predictors to catch the correct cases. For example  **price < 20 AND price > 95**, or even better we would take **customer_id = 1001 OR customer_id = 1922 OR customer_id = 1004**. This would lead us in the totally wrong direction. \n\nWe wany yo create a tool that will predict for future customers whether they will abandon or not, and thw method of counting by **customer_id** (means focusing only on this column without thinking about other features) who has abandoned so far will certainly nt help us to win a client **customer_id = 5555**, neither to keep the customer **customer_id = 0003**.\n\n\n## 3. Classification and marketing\n\nHere it is appropriate to give one important maxim:\n\n_**Acquisition of new clients and retention of existing clients are the two main tasks of marketing**._ \n\nThe emphasis may be a little more on one or the other, but this is the *essence* of marketing. \n\nWe want to \"learn\" from the data the cobination of properties shared by customers who have given up, and then, based on that combinatiom, try to see what our problem is, but also predict whether customer 5555 will have the same problem, and thus be able to act preventively on his retention. In practice, retention is the most common way to eliminate difficulties for clients, beacuse the main reason for leaving (which we can act on) is some problem with our system. Of course, there are other reasons, but they are (a) significantly more difficult to find, and (b) significantly more difficult to act on.\n\nAnother aspect of this analysis is to see where there is room for acqusition. The asquisition is simpler on the one hand, and more complex on the other.\n\nIt is easier to find the best predictor for  **end_result = 3**, and analyze the result. With a little luck, among the best results we will have valuable insights, eg. **age > 25 AND age < 40 AND gender = f**, with which we can then run very good targeted campaigns.\n\nIt is more complex in that the acquisition can also be viewed in the way of  *cross-selling*, that is, if we have learned from our data that clients who buy any book for over 70 USD most often also buy item 258, then anyone who puts in basket a book over 70 USD  we want to offer and an item 258 (maybe with a discount) \n\n\n## 4. Decision trees\n\nDecision trees select features and combine them so that a specific oreder of their application is obtained. The main trick is to measure which features give the best disicirmination, and take them first. A good example is predicting who did (and who would) survive on the  _Titanic_ (borrowing an image from Wikipedia)\n\n<img src=\"dt.png\">\n\nThe numbers below the elements of the image indicate the probability of survival (decimal numbers of the form 0.34), and the percentage of the tatal caeses that are in that category (Which, for the sake of rounding, add up to 101%, but this is not important noe). A probability of survival above 0.5 is considered the \"survived\" category, and below 0.5 is considered the \"died\" category (this technique where the numerical scale is divided into two categories before and after a ceryain limit is called \"thresholding\").\n\nSo, if a person is female, her probability of survival is 0.73 (73%). If he is a male and older than 9.5 years, then he probably died (survival probability  0.17, i.e. 17%). Male persons younger than 9.5 years who have less than 2.5 brothers and sisters had the best chance of survival (0.89, or 89% chance, although  there were very few of them, or 2% of the total population). This 2% means that there were quite a few samples with this predictor (**sex = m AND age < 9.5 AND sibsp < 2.5**), which means that perhaps this classification is not the most reliable, that is, it may be too dependent on the chance.\n\nClassification based on gender gives a 0.73 chance of survival, but this has the ability to easily (with only one feature **sex**) capture 36% of the overall data. In a certain sense, it is the strongest feature and the most stable (which also follows common sense intuition). \n\nThis is the basis of the functioning of decision trees: the decision tree tries to find an order by delimiting first by the strongest feature, and then by the weaker feature. \n\nThis does **not** mean that the strongest feature is the one that gives the greatest chance of survival (that is, the biggest difference regarding *thresholdinga*), because that is no longer importnant, what matters is whether it is above 0.5, so it gets the lable \"SURVIVABLE\" or below, so it gets the lable \"DYING\". \n\nThe strongest feature is the one that best divides the samples, so in our case 36% vs 64%. The details of how the tree calculates exactly which oreder it will go in are complex ( and that's exactly why we use an algorithm and not do this manually), but this description is the intuition behind it.\n\nNow we are ready to build a decision tree over our data. The next few cells shoul be executed with Shift+Enter, and we give explanations below them.",
