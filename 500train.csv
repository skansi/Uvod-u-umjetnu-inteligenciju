"2","Stuning even for the non-gamer","This sound track was beautiful! It paints the senery in your mind so well I would recomend it even to people who hate vid. game music! I have played the game Chrono Cross but out of all of the games I have ever played it has the best music! It backs away from crude keyboarding and takes a fresher step with grate guitars and soulful orchestras. It would impress anyone who cares to listen! ^_^"
"2","The best soundtrack ever to anything.","I'm reading a lot of reviews saying that this is the best 'game soundtrack' and I figured that I'd write a review to disagree a bit. This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece. The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade.The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny."
"2","Amazing!","This soundtrack is my favorite music of all time, hands down. The intense sadness of ""Prisoners of Fate"" (which means all the more if you've played the game) and the hope in ""A Distant Promise"" and ""Girl who Stole the Star"" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years. The higher energy tracks like ""Chrono Cross ~ Time's Scar~"", ""Time of the Dreamwatch"", and ""Chronomantique"" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well.This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer's work (I haven't heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can't say for sure), and even if you've never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it.I wish I could give it 6 stars."
"2","Excellent Soundtrack","I truly like this soundtrack and I enjoy video game music. I have played this game and most of the music on here I enjoy and it's truly relaxing and peaceful.On disk one. my favorites are Scars Of Time, Between Life and Death, Forest Of Illusion, Fortress of Ancient Dragons, Lost Fragment, and Drowned Valley.Disk Two: The Draggons, Galdorb - Home, Chronomantique, Prisoners of Fate, Gale, and my girlfriend likes ZelbessDisk Three: The best of the three. Garden Of God, Chronopolis, Fates, Jellyfish sea, Burning Orphange, Dragon's Prayer, Tower Of Stars, Dragon God, and Radical Dreamers - Unstealable Jewel.Overall, this is a excellent soundtrack and should be brought by those that like video game music.Xander Cross"
"2","Remember, Pull Your Jaw Off The Floor After Hearing it","If you've played the game, you know how divine the music is! Every single song tells a story of the game, it's that good! The greatest songs are without a doubt, Chrono Cross: Time's Scar, Magical Dreamers: The Wind, The Stars, and the Sea and Radical Dreamers: Unstolen Jewel. (Translation varies) This music is perfect if you ask me, the best it can be. Yasunori Mitsuda just poured his heart on and wrote it down on paper."
"2","an absolute masterpiece","I am quite sure any of you actually taking the time to read this have played the game at least once, and heard at least a few of the tracks here. And whether you were aware of it or not, Mitsuda's music contributed greatly to the mood of every single minute of the whole game.Composed of 3 CDs and quite a few songs (I haven't an exact count), all of which are heart-rendering and impressively remarkable, this soundtrack is one I assure you you will not forget. It has everything for every listener -- from fast-paced and energetic (Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home), to slower and more haunting (Dragon God), to purely beautifully composed (Time's Scar), to even some fantastic vocals (Radical Dreamers).This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there, and surely Mitsuda's best ever. ^_^"
"1","Buyer beware","This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been written by Ms. Haddon's family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another. It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a ""worst book"" contest. I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing. Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on ""To Kill a Mockingbird""--a book I am quite sure Ms. Haddon never heard of. Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!"
"2","Glorious story","I loved Whisper of the wicked saints. The story was amazing and I was pleasantly surprised at the changes in the book. I am not normaly someone who is into romance novels, but the world was raving about this book and so I bought it. I loved it !! This is a brilliant story because it is so true. This book was so wonderful that I have told all of my friends to read it. It is not a typical romance, it is so much more. Not reading this book is a crime, becuase you are missing out on a heart warming story."
"2","A FIVE STAR BOOK","I just finished reading Whisper of the Wicked saints. I fell in love with the caracters. I expected an average romance read, but instead I found one of my favorite books of all time. Just when I thought I could predict the outcome I was shocked ! The writting was so descriptive that my heart broke when Julia's did and I felt as if I was there with them instead of just a distant reader. If you are a lover of romance novels then this is a must read. Don't let the cover fool you this book is spectacular!"
"2","Whispers of the Wicked Saints","This was a easy to read book that made me want to keep reading on and on, not easy to put down.It left me wanting to read the follow on, which I hope is coming soon. I used to read a lot but have gotten away from it. This book made me want to read again. Very enjoyable."
"1","The Worst!","A complete waste of time. Typographical errors, poor grammar, and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing. I'm embarrassed for this author and very disappointed I actually paid for this book."
"2","Great book","This was a great book,I just could not put it down,and could not read it fast enough. Boy what a book the twist and turns in this just keeps you guessing and wanting to know what is going to happen next. This book makes you fall in love and can heat you up,it can also make you so angery. this book can make you go throu several of your emotions. This is a quick read romance. It is something that you will want to end your day off with if you read at night."
"2","Great Read","I thought this book was brilliant, but yet realistic. It showed me that to error is human. I loved the fact that this writer showed the loving side of God and not the revengeful side of him. I loved how it twisted and turned and I could not put it down. I also loved The glass castle."
"1","Oh please","I guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one, and not a very discerning one. All others beware! It is absolute drivel. I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the book removed all doubt. Wait - maybe I'm missing the point. A quick re-read of the beginning now makes it clear. This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes. Phew, so glad I didn't waste $10.95 after all."
"1","Awful beyond belief!","I feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money. This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a ""lean"" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!"
"1","Don't try to fool us with fake reviews.","It's glaringly obvious that all of the glowing reviews have been written by the same person, perhaps the author herself. They all have the same misspellings and poor sentence structure that is featured in the book. Who made Veronica Haddon think she is an author?"
"2","A romantic zen baseball comedy","When you hear folks say that they don't make 'em like that anymore, they might be talking about ""BY THE SEA"". This is a very cool story about a young Cuban girl searching for idenity who stumbles into a coastal resort kitchen gig with a zen motorcycle maintenance man, three hysterical Italian chefs and a Latino fireballing right handed pitcher who plays on the team sponsored by the resort's owner. As is often the case she 'finds' herself through honest, often comical but always emotional, interaction with this sizzling roster of players. With the perfect mix of special effects, that salsa sound and flashbacks, BY THE SEA, gets 4 BIG stars from me!"
"2","Fashionable Compression Stockings!","After I had a DVT my doctor required me to wear compression stockings. I wore ugly white TED hose and yucky thick brown stockings. Then I found Jobst UltraSheer. They gave me the compression I needed (15-20,) but looked like regular pantyhose. Even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years, I still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice.**Note, I have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh. I tried the Jobst adhesive, but I hated having my skin pulled all day. I bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling."
"2","Jobst UltraSheer Thigh High","Excellent product. However, they are very difficult to get on for older people. I feel like I've had a full day workout after getting them on. Also, as the day wears on, they begin to roll down from the top and create a very deep ridge in the skin. I have to wear them, so if those two difficulties could be addressed it would be such a help."
"1","sizes recomended in the size chart are not real","sizes are much smaller than what is recomended in the chart. I tried to put it and sheer it!. I guess you should not buy this item in the internet..it is better to go to the store and check it"
"1","mens ultrasheer","This model may be ok for sedentary types, but I'm active and get around alot in my job - consistently found these stockings rolled up down by my ankles! Not Good!! Solution: go with the standard compression stocking, 20-30, stock #114622. Excellent support, stays up and gives me what I need. Both pair of these also tore as I struggled to pull them up all the time. Good riddance/bad investment!"
"2","Delicious cookie mix","I thought it was funny that I bought this product without knowing it was a mix. I read the header very quickly and just thought it was packaged cookies. But no, it is cookie MIX and I guess I should have noticed that since it is right in the title.This is the first time I have ever tried baking with a cookie mix. If you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise. Mixing up the dough can get VERY messy (it is extremely sticky). However, with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients (I like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy). Also, this mix has really large chocolate chips in it--I love that.I removed a star for the addition of 'natural flavors' in the mix."
"1","Another Abysmal Digital Copy","Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution. Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer.If you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white. The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded. Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visuals.After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE. Somewhere ""out there"" is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reel.Just none of them appear to be on Amazon."
"2","A fascinating insight into the life of modern Japanese teens","I thoroughly enjoyed Rising Sons and Daughters. I don't know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community, and their peers' adulation of Western culture. True to form, the ""New Young"" of Japan seem to be creating an ""international"" blend, as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family. Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author, adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens, and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out. A great read!"
"2","i liked this album more then i thought i would","I heard a song or two and thought same o same o,but when i listened to songs like ""blue angel"",""lanna"" and 'mama"" the hair just rose off my neck.Roy is trully an amazing singer with a talent you don't find much now days."
"1","Problem with charging smaller AAAs","I have had the charger for more than two years. It charges AA batteries just fine, but has a huge problem securing smaller AAA batteries. To charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end. In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up, and now three out of the four won't hold. The problem is the flip mechanism became loose, and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up. What I have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon, apply the crayon on the buttons, and wrap the tape around. You know how painful that is."
"1","Works, but not as advertised","I bought one of these chargers..the instructions say the lights stay on while the battery charges...true. The instructions doNT say the lights turn off when its done. Which is also true. 24 hours of charging and the lights stay on. I returned it thinking I had a bad unit.The new one did the same thing. I just kept it since it does charge...but the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on. It's a ""backup"" charger for when I manage to drain all my AAs but I wouldn't want this as my only charger."
"1","Disappointed","I read the reviews,made my purchase and was very disappointed. The charger is convenient by charging all four batteries at once but the charge only lasts a very short time. I now have to go and find batteries that will give me longer life than the kodak NiMH AA batteries."
"1","Oh dear","I was excited to find a book ostensibly about Muslim feminism, but this volume did not live up to the expectations.One essay, among other things, describes the veil as potentially liberating. It doesn't begin to explain how or why.Another, on Muslim women in Cape Town, claims that Muslim women there are separate but ""more than equal."" Gee whiz, what a disappointment.I had expected and hoped for at least one Muslim feminist condemnation of gender apartheid. But there is not a single one in the book.I'm surprised it didn't have an essay extolling the virtues of female genital mutilation.--Alyssa A. Lappen"
"2","Based on the reviews here I bought one and I'm glad I did!","This VCR/DVD was an early Christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in DVD-land but not wanting to let go of my VHS movies quite yet. Based on the reviews and price, and because I own a JVC TV, this was my choice. I agree with the easy set-up. It's a bit awkward to work the whole TV/VHS/DVD selection options but I think I've gotten the hang of it.Two comments: it's not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated (too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me) so I've had to rely heavily on the how-to manual. And setting the VCR timer is awkward -- you can't enter the start and end time but have to scroll (unless I'm missing something)...but those are my only complaints. This is a good product for your $$$."
"1","Incorrect disc!","I am a big JVC fan, but I do not like this model, I was suspiscious when I saw several units in the return section of the store. I bought one anyway (new) and must say I am not happy. The unit sends out clicks to the receiver once in a while, the transition between scenes is not always smooth,(like a little pause) and while it is still fairly new I can't get any DVD,CD or even a DVD headcleaner to work. All I get is a ""incorrect disc"" message."
"2","happy with it...but","I'm a JVC nut...I have 3 JVC televisions, one VCR, one bookshelf audio system and car audio system. So when it came time to move the VCR player to the boys room and get another one for the old man I knew what make it was going to be. I decided on the combo player because I don't think VHS is going to be around much longer. I like my combo player except for 2 things:(1)no cable box compatability on the remote control (2)no seperate audio video inputs only input for coax cable from my cable box so all of the cable programming is in mono...wife can't tell the difference in the sound so if she's happy then I'll just live with it. VCR and DVD look and sound GREAT!!!!!!!"
"1","should be titled ""Hollywood Debacle""","The plot is so ridiculous, I have to wonder if they even read the script before making this film. The mountain lion breaks out of his trailer - and the cars behind don't notice? The mountain lion is captured - and put in a jail cell? Get real! Utterly, completely stupid."
"2","Is this great TV??? You bet it is","Hotel Babylon is not just good TV...it's great TV!!!! The show features some incredible acting from Tamzin Outhwaite (formerly of EastEnders, a BBC soap) and Max Beesley (from the ill-fated movie ""Glitter"" starring Mariah Carey). The show could make for a great drama series, but I felt that it is a mix of a drama, comedy, and soap opera all mixed into a great BBC show. The show aired on BBC America for a while but didn't get around to seeing it. I can now say that I got the DVD set and all the episodes are great. The season finale was an interesting to watch.The show reminds me of Hotel which aired on ABC from 1983 to 1988. The reason...Hotel was set at a fictional San Francisco hotel as Hotel Babylon was set at a luxury five-star hotel in England.I recommend this DVD to anyone who is willing to watch a great show from the BBC."
"1","Nothing you don't already know","If you have even casually looked into applying to law school, have already read everything there is in this book, do not waste your money, seriously!!"
"1","Unfortunately it wasn't entertaining in the least bit.","When I first ordered the CD, I figured it was going to be a hip, cool daddy vibe CD. However much to my dismay it sounds like a fourth grade music class. The main jist of the CD is that there is a xylaphone playing over peoples voices trying to replicate happening party. I believe if I played this CD at a party anywhere in my neighborhood I would get laughed off the beach. Growing up a surfer in San Diego, I would not recommend this CD to any of my Southern California brothers. Honestly, when I played it I kinda of felt I was in a bad B movie. The absolutle epitimy of the CD is the last ""vibe"" Surf Cha Cha. Surfers don't CHA."
"2","Rochelle explains It All for You","Wondering what the hell has happened to the moral aspect of modern American culture ? This book is a lucid, well argued explanation of the simple fact that we have become so totally focused on our individual RIGHTS that we have completely ignored, and even mocked, our personal and public responsibilities. The final response and indictment of Robert Ringer's best seller, LOOKING OUT FOR #1. This is a great time for anyone who is disgusted with the boorish state of American media, politics and discourse in general, to clear their heads for the substantial challenges that lie before us not only as Americans, but as human beings. A great book"
"2","More great playing","Larry's work for the Muse label in the late 80s and early 90s found him exploring the rich catalog of jazz standards that he probably grew up playing. Surrounding himself with the best musicians around, Larry sounds relaxed, focused, and totally in control. Listen to Larry's take on ""My Funny Valentine"" and tell me it doesn't stand right up there with Chet Baker's or Miles'. A very fine album that you'll enjoy again and again."
"1","Doesn't work on a Mac","It clearly says on line this will work on a Mac OS system. The disk comes and it does not, only Windows . Do Not order this if you have a Mac!!!!!!!"
"1","Very Frustrating","My three year old son was very excited to get this but after two attempts at playing it hasn't been touched since. You are not able to use the mouse through any of the games except for the ""power-up segments"" instead you are using the up-down arrows on the keyboard - too hard for him and not much fun. Very disapointed with this game and wish I could return it."
"1","Mind numbing","This game makes you do the same things over and over, it never holds my son's attention long enough to get to the next level. There is no choice of games you have to do every thing in order. We have another Rescue Heroes game and both my boys 3 and 6 love it, but this one is a dog!"
"1","Cannot recommend","As a former Alaskan, I didn't want to have to do this. But after repeatedly attempting Allman's recipes and having to throw out 8-10 cups of flour and miscellaneous ingredients nearly every time--and then comparing to Ed Wood's recipes which work flawlessly, and Lisa Rayner's very excellent Wild Bread: Hand-baked sourdough artisan breads in your own kitchen, I can't help but notice that their recipes work, where Allman's fail.I'm not a novice baker. The only thing that worked reliably was the pancakes recipe, but that can be found other places as well.If you are looking for reliable recipes and concise information about starting a sourdough and maintaining it, I recommend any of Ed Wood's books, even his very old ones. Lisa Rayner has written a fabulous tome in Wild Bread. But pass on this book.While some of the historical vignettes were interesting--not enough so to warrant the cost of the book. Check it out at your library if you must."
"2","Alaska sourdough","REad most of the book while visiting my brother in Alaska. Loved it. I am going to be making my sourdough starter soon. Book is full of great stories and recipes."
"2","Old and good","This book is worth to keep in your collection as it does not only advise what to do with sourdough but Ruth also told you what the picture of past 100 years ago in Alaska where no stand mixer nor any civilized stuffs in kitchen, just a pot of sourdough."
"2","autumn","got this for my daughter in NC, she is now making prefect bread. Wish she lived closer to make me some"
"2","Fast mp3 download of music waxed decades ago","One of these 26 songs played as background music on a YouTube video of some kind of gymnastic or dance feat out of Russia. I hunted down the melody, read the English lyrics, then decided to see what else was in the album. Downloaded the full album for $15 via Amazon mp3 downloader, and now happily listen to the melodies (interspersed) on my iPod."
"1","Maybe I got a bad one.","My experience: I got this from FM, not Amazon. The DVD player rattled pretty loudly sometimes (but not always) when I put in a DVD. I tried several. The picture quality wasn't all that great and the screen got a horizontal line thru the middle after a short time that would not go away. Plus one of the other reviewers was dead on about the remote - the layout makes no sense at all! Very poor human engineering, IMO. I brought it back to the store for a refund. I saw the same model under the Emerson name for <$400 at WM but was hesitant to buy it."
"2","Sylvania 6620LDG 20"" Flat Panel LCD TV with Built in DVD player","Light weight, space saving very attractive design. Sharp Picture, Good sound quality and quick response time. DVD playback also excellent. Only negative is its remote control. It is hard to read the functions of the keys due to color choices. The placement of the keys are almost illogical and you have to look at it carefully before each use. It almost seems like it was designed by an imbecil. The quality, the features and the price still makes this TV an excellent buy."
"1","TERRIBLE!! DO NOT BUY THIS","I bought this for my wife for her birthday,and had toreturn it because the DVD palyer would not work. I returned it and got a repalcement, which once again the DVD player failed to work! It is a piece of junk."
"1","*** BEWARE ***","This TV is set so that it is not capable of a ""recall"" function. If you want to flash back between channels, this TV is not going to give it to you. The remote control that comes with the TV has no recall function, so I bought a Sony universal, which is a much better remote, that had the recall button on it. However, I soon learned that the TV is set at the factory to not have the capability to flash-back. It may not be a big deal to some, but this user found it very annoying."
"2","Kitchen TV","I bought this to replace a 13"" tube tv in my kitchen. What I gained was a larger screen plus relcaiming the counter space. The picture is good, and the internal DVD player is a bonus. All in all, a good purchase."
"2","Nice for the money","The first one I bought was defective. The DVD didn't work at all. I purchased it from Electronics Express and when I contacted them they were wonderful. They gave me an RMA number right away, Fedex picked it up the next day and a new one arrived 1 week later. This one is just fine. I really love the clarity of the picture. My only complaint is that in DVD mode, the sound isn't loud enough. I have it in my RV and with the A/C running, I can barely hear it. I solved the problem by running an audio out jack from the TV to the input on the RV stereo speaker system. It's very lightweight and easy to move around and store. A bonus for the RV. The remote isn't great, but it works just fine and the video/audio jacks and antenna input are easy to get to as is the DVD player. All in all, it's a great deal for the price."
"1","Disappointed Romanian!","This book in my opinion is biased and takes an angle of Europe that is ""clean and proper"" and fails to shed light on the rest of it. I can understand that these are ""tourist guides"" and why would anyone want to tour a country forgotten by time. However, I am a very disappointed Romanian with this book and would never use it as my reference. I have seen travel guides outlining Europe exclude Romania before, but with the precision and detail of DK's series, I was left yet again in disappointment."
"2","Great travel guide to Europe!","This book is realy great for everybody who likes to travel Europe. The combination of good pictures, illustration and texts is perfect. You get a good overall view for the most important sights, places, cities and countries in Europe and also a bit of historical information. As a European who already traveled a bit I still could find a lot of inspiration to more interesting places to go. Thank a lot to Eyewitness Travel for there great books!"
"1","Not the best","I bought both this and lonely planet and have used lonely planet more because this book is full of pictures but doesn't give you all the info you need. Also, I ended up buying each indiv city guide as well because this one only scratches the surface!"
"2","Good but received defective book","I bought this book because we are moving to Germany and I wanted to get a good overview of all the countries in Europe that we could travel too. Unfortunately pages 457-480 on Greece are not in English - looks to be Spanish. There was some sort of printing problem! But I found the rest of the book to give good highlights of the countries."
"2","From The Label:","From Memphis, TN. comes The Reatards, fronted, of course, by wild kid Jay Reatard. He starting off on Eric Oblivians label, Goner, at the tender age of 15. Jay, now 19, is still rocking and offending the sensibilities of his community. Overdriven, loud, crackling guitars underlaying Jay's southern crooning howl energizes some of the most amazing hate-filled song writing we've heard in years."
"1","Either 1 or 5 Stars. Depends on how you look at it.","Either 1 or 5 Stars. Depends on how you look at it.1 Star because they sent 6 feet of 2"" OD copper pipe.0 Star because they won't accept returns on it.5 stars because I figure it's actually worth $12-15/foot and since they won't take a return I figure I can sell it and make $40-50 on this deal"
"2","Hunting the Hard Way","Thia was a gift for my Husband, who loved the book. It arrived on the date we were told it would."
"1","Disappointing","The text is the same as ever (I think), but the plates are markedly inferior to all previous editions. Had I known this ahead of time, I would not have purchased this volume."
"2","Homer or Moses?","An extremely helpful gem on a complex subject of second century religious authority and textual use. For anyone serious about this period and the interelation of cultures, this book is essential. Is it complex and detailed? Of course, it must be to argue the point. Should you buy it? Yes, unless you want to keep running back to the library. I write this only after thoroughly disagreeing with the review above."
"1","Very poor quality.","The screen arrived in a cardboard box that was pretty beat up. The screen itself is very lightweight, very cheesy looking. The ""finish"" was worn across the entire top of the screen. I knew this wasn't solid brass, but I expected something that at least looked decent from a distance for the price I paid."
"1","Scraped across the whole top.","Purchased this screen last week and it came with noticeable scrapes across the top. The box it came in was gigantic with plenty of packaging material, but the screen was packaged loosely at the bottom. However, since it was in another smaller box, I'm thinking that the scraping was there to begin with, and not from shipping. Still deciding whether to go through the trouble of exchanging it since another reviewer said they had the same damage. I wouldn't want to risk getting another with the same damage and I really need a screen right now. Other than the damage, it's a very nice screen."
"2","unknown Africa","You don't expect music from africa to be so profesionally produced. Me from the white world, don't understand the lyrics, but we do understand the music which is a mixture between salsa, soukous and fado with always the african feeling for rithem. The soft almost borred voice of Oliver N'goma fits pefectly in the music. The CD is recorded in France Paris, you can hear that professionals have been working on the CD. A must for a hot, lazy night.greetings Arno, Amsterdam"
"1","Didn't live up to expectations.","I ordered these shoes to replace the previous pair that had ripped apart at the sole. Clark said they did not make this shoe anymore, so I had to order them through Amazon. Sadly, the second pair ripped in the same place within 3 months. My son has since bought a similar pair from Sperry and they seem to be holding up much better."
"1","Profound then. Truly horrible now.","The narrative style of this work by famous founders' biographer John Morse is arrogant, flippant and frequently exaggerated. It carries the tone of the amateur Yankee historian on high, passing judgment on this Southern statesman who was neither from Boston nor a Harvard graduate. Perhaps considered penetrating for its day, it really represents nothing more than opinion today. The research is so thin that one must conclude that Morse wrote the entire manuscript essentially from memory, with little reference to the primary and secondary sources we expect of historians now. If it weren't for the fact that Morse wrote this piece 110 years ago, I'd have rated it only one star."
"2","Definitely enjoyed!","This was a gift for my 6 yr old daughter. She is a big Barbie fan as well as loves to use the computer. She is still enjoying this game. She completed it in a few hours which worried me at first, but she loves to do it over and over again. The music is enjoyable and the colors are vibrant. It seems to be very user friendly also....my daughter has not really needed my help to use it once she started it the first time."
"2","Even Mommy has fun with this one!","My four year old daughter loves everything Barbie and loves the Rapunzel movie. This game is tons of fun, even for a 42 year old. We love playing it together. We love decorating all the rooms and finding the gems. What even better is, she can play it alone and I get some me time!"
"2","Great combination of creativity and adventure","My 4 year old daughter has been addicted to this game. She plays it over and over again. She loves the opening song and has been singing it non stop. She gets excited each time she completes a room and finds a gem and loves solving the maze to find Prince Stefan. The only problem is that she sings the song so much I can't get it out of my head!"
"2","Rapunzel","This is such a great game both my 3 year old son and 7 year old daughter love it. I like to play to if they would let me! So much fun decorating the rooms and so many choices to keep you playing Great game. Not at all what you would think a Barbie game would be. Great fun for all!!"
"1","[Not what I expected]","... My daughter and I loved the movie. She is 5 years old and it took her 2 hours to complete the game. Absolutely no challenge, and very little interaction. It is essentially just clicking on the screen to make it play the 7 or 8 scenes it has programmed. There are no games to play, nothing to figure out, nothing to do. Save your money."
"1","barbie rapunzel = crying child","My 6-year old daughter is currently sobbing in her bedroom as a result of this rotten game.She spent an hour on this game painting in pretty pictures and coloring in flowers. But halfway through the game, the program hung, and wouldn't let us leave the room or click anywhere else. Now even if we exit the game and then start it back up, we are frozen in one spot while Barbie's disembodied voice urges us to ""explore somewhere else in the castle.""Standard software troubleshooting and rebooting didn't help. Vivendi Games' support site is ""currently disabled."" And now I'm left with a weeping, frustrating child who doesn't understand that it is not her fault that her game won't work. I'm hoping it was just incompetent software programming that couldn't catch the bug my 6-year old caught the first time around. Or maybe they just don't care about the problems, so long as you get our 20 bucks. If you don't want a crying little girl, avoid this game!"
"2","Barbie as Rapunzel: A Creative Adventure","I purchased this software for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves playing it so much. She lets me play it sometimes, but she doesn't always like what I come up with. I plan to purchase other software programs for her."
"2","Use your imagination!","My 3 year old daughter & I both love this software. We actually fight over who is going paint the pictures or choose the themes for each room. This game allows you to be creative & use your imagination by ""decorating"" each room of the castle and finding the missing gems to the prince's crown which gives Rapunzel the power to find Prince Stephan who has been turned to stone & bring him back to life. The music & animation is the best I have seen. Most of the kids software that I've seen is boring to me as an adult, but this is not at all. I sometimes like to play it without her! There are so many variations on color schemes & patterns & that you can never be bored. I highly recommend this for girls of all ages."
"1","Not so good - ok for a rental!","This game is pretty exciting and it is very nice and it is really creative and one of a kind. The only bad thing is that there is only one ""castle"" for the kids to ""decorate"" and once you are done with the whole castle that is basically it. You either have to create a new username for yourself to do it all over again or you get another game like I did. My sister finished the ""castle"" in about 2 hours and after that has never even looked at this game anymore. It is a nice game and it is fun but it is not really worth that much money."
"1","NOT OS X but MAC CLASSIC","NEGATIVE: This game does not work with OS X and requires the CD so you can't have it on multiple computers. It is slow I have to tell my daughter that it is thinking a lot, this is because it has to access the CD everytime there is a new task. You can't view the openning sequence again without throwing out the saved game files. Some of the tasks and controls are too hard and not user friendly even for adults.it CRASHES all the time.Mouse is jumpy and hard to use.POSITIVE: Some tasks are easy, possible to use, grand and beautiful.My three year has enough patience to survive the multiple trials to get this to work."
"1","Bad Deal!!","I ordered this DVD and received a substitute I never received the DVD I ordered from Importcds (the Vendor). I contacted them and did not recieve any feedback. I can't rate a DVD I have never seen. I didn't bother to send it back because it would have cost me more that I orginally paid for it. In the future I will watch for the name of the person and/or persons I am buying from. I thought they were a good company. I understand a simple mistake but, to not get a response at all is not good businees sense. I spend hundreds of dollars a month on Amazon.com building my DVD collection. I guess I will be more careful in the future."
"2","Smells divine.","This is my second bottle of sheer freesia, I just love this fragrance, its a light delicate sent, beautiful, like a summer day."
"1","Very disappointed!","This perfume is just AWFUL! Smells nothing like freesia.The gift recipient was not impressed. The worst is that it can't be returned!"
"2","Creepy","Wow, what people will do behind jealousy and revenge - there are some doors you should not open, and if you do - be prepared for what you find behind it!"
"1","audio options non existent","While the movie in itself was better than i expected what i didnt expect was the ""non existent"" Thai soundtrack. While the option was on the disc menu (as well as stated on the package) the Thai soundtrack does not exist. No matter what you choose, Thai or English, English is what you get and while there are some exceptions most dubbing is ridiculous at best and the dubbing on this title is sub par. While this review covers only the first movie of the two the other may remain in plastic never to see the inside of my dvd player. Its a shame and a sham when you purchase what claims to be original and is not. Very disapointed in this offering from Tokyo Shock."
"2","Sooo JAMMIN', too trill","Man, some more jammin tracks from the SUC. This is Pokey's first official record....and sh** is sooo real. Love the production, everything is real nice & screwed out. This is among the last of the great SUC records. Not to say they've fallen off....just they've downsized so much with the deaths of the screw pioneers. Sad but true. If ya love Tx rap, you've gotta get this 1. Somethin to kickback & blow big too, somethin to jam in the ride. So underrated, right here. I wish people would forget all the bullsh** on BET/MTV and check what's happening in Houston. But i guess...it's sadly almost too late. Pat's gone, hawk's gone...screw, Moe, Pimp C, Big Steve. Makes me sad. Regardless, Pokey is still alive and making new music, keeping the legacy alive. And this is a great place to start with him. Classic record. Love it, man"
"2","Dirty South","This is probably the best southside CD to ever come out. Pretty much every song has a guest or 2 on the track. From the late Fat Pat, to Botany Boys, Mr. 3-2, Big Steve, Chris Ward, H.A.W.K, and many more. This is how a southside CD should always be."
"2","Good book","Well written chronicles of The Farm from the people who lived it. Excellent photos as well.I kept looking for a photo of me and my then-wife, but I wasn't there long enough. But shewas :-)"
"2","voices from the farm","i have a copy of this book and love it and can't wait til the revised version comes out in a few weeks"
"2","Little one, maid of Israel","Bill Harvey has a wonderful gift of making history come alive in this book. This book awakens a sense of wonder at the possiblility of a real relationship with God as you follow the faithfulness of one little girl in ancient times. Young girls ages 5-15 will love this book. It has always been one of my most loved treasures, a real Keeper !"
"1","It Drew Air","This book drew air pretty bad. I have no idea why someone would waste their time writing it. Boy did it draw air. Do not read this book."
"2","comfy,warm.. but run big","just like the title says. Warm, comfy but run a size too big. I don't wear them out as they are just for lounging, so it's not that big of a deal for me."
"1","Buyer Beware!!","I ordered the cake topper June 27, 2010. I was given an estimated shipping date of July 1-7, 2010. Those dates came & went with no cake topper. I contacted the seller twice with no response. I filed a claim with Amazon. I did end up receiving a cake topper on July 16, 2010; however, it's not even the one I ordered! The seller did refund my money, but has never contacted me or apologized for the mishap. I will never buy anything from the seller again. I looked at the seller's feedback & I'm not the only person they have done wrong, so buyer beware!!"
"1","Ariel Litte Mermaid with pearl kit","Arrived very quickly and it is a cute topper however I wouldn't have bought it if they didn't provide instructions!!!! I should have listened to the other reviews.... If you are hoping to get more than the topper DO NOT BUY THIS!! So annoyed I have this Ariel and have no idea how to decorate the cake."
"1","No instructions included - do not trust seller","Promised with this item are ""Complete Instructions"" and the additional pledge that ""Sweet Graces will email you with the Supply List and Instruction sheets on purchase - so you can be ready ahead of time!"" I received none of this - only a plastic figurine and bracelet. To boot, Amazon claims they can do nothing to help me contact the seller. All I got was a phone number for the manufacturer. Let's hope that yields some results. Meanwhile, I'm wishing I had listened to previous feedback about this unreliable seller :/"
"2","Why is SOULWAX ignored by critics & consumers alike?!","I just don't get it - SOULWAX has been around since the 90s, when they released their ""rock"" debut (on the now defunct Almo Sounds), chock full of should-have-been radio hits, and then when while they got some attention for their ""2 Many DJs"" mash-up/remix bootlegs, when they return to a full-fledged band, as with last year's ANY MINUTE NOW, critcs & consumers alike barely took notice of that album's amazing writing, production, and sheer electro-rock power. Hopefully, ""Nite Versions"" (a cheeky title recalling when 80s bands like Duran Duran used to release ""Nite Version"" on 12"" of singles for clubs) will garner more sales and attention for SOULWAX - the songs practically leap out of the speakers to grab your neck and turn you head and make you move. Can't wait to hear what they do TIGA on his upcoming ""Sexor"" debut...?"
"2","OMG Soulwax owns","wow - this is like the most amazing album ever. Every track so rocks...specially1) E-talking2) NyLipps3) I love Techo.great job guysMusicChoice played their whole album this Saturday night..and I was jamming to it the whole time going ""wow"".one more thing, if you're not into House/Techno/electronic then you don't want none of this, cause you won't feel it."
"1","Slow dull ""classical"" 1980's style movie","2 stars of 5 for this slow dull ""classical"" 1980's style movie. This movie has a young Jason Bateman in the lead. Very very very slow and dull with a few moments of bad 1980's style music. To our relief the background music (which is very annoying) is kept to a minimum. Though it attempts to be an action/suspense movie, it achieves neither. I'd suggest skipping this movie."
"2","Thank you for Releasing it!!!!!","I loved this movie as a kid and I am so happy the powers that be have decided to release it finally! If you want to see a great 80's movie, this is it!"
"1","Very Not Worth Your Time","The book was wriiten very horribly. I would never in my life recommend such a book. The stories lacked any mystery to them and did not leave me wanting to figure out who the culprit was. The only good thing was that none of the stories took up ten or twelve pages."
"2","Very fun and educational","Trains, shapes and pegs - a winning combination, guaranteed to make both the child and the parent happy. Good starter puzzle for the 1 yr old range."
"1","Ludicrous and silly","I remember getting this book so faintly that that says alot about my opinion of it. Basically, while I will entertain lots of odd ideas and theories, this book was basically silly."
"2","Artistry","I think that the Deodato concerts are very rich, as he used real strings and band musicians, as well as you can appreciate the John Tropea excelent renditions on guitar."
"1","Caution!","These tracks are not the ""original"" versions but are re-recorded versions. So, whether the tracks are ""remastered"" or not is irrelevant."
"2","textbook","Book shipped quickly and was in excellent condition as stated. Easy transaction would buy again"
"2","a great book for Historical romance lovers","This is an engaging a count of life of Tess a girl who at a young age washed up on the shore of the Isle of May. With no memory of the life before then, she stays with the old caretakers of the isle. After the caretakers are dead a young man, Colin Macpherson washes up on shore. Colin takes Tess back with her to his castle where he helps her uncover her past. They are opposites,but you know what they say opposites attract. This book is just one of many in the Avon True Romance series. I have read every book in the series and I know that if you like this book you love the rest. This is a great book for girls about 10 to 16 because it is still a romance novel, but not what you call a trashy romance novel. It is a great novel fokr those who are just getting into romance novels."
"2","YES!!!","When I got this book, I wasn't expecting much, but man was I wrong! I loved this book! Now I may not usually be tied in by a man with long blond hair wearing a kilt, but the authors really made Colin into this enchanting Highlander. Tess is a very soft heroine. While she sometimes seems too guillible, I have to remember that it is part of the story. This is one of my favorite books in the series."
"1","Not the best in the series","Tess Lindsay is content to be the sole occupant of a remote island but when Colin Macpherson washes ashore her life of solitude gets shaken up. Tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with Colin. Soon Tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new life?The beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem. The plot loses much of it's believability mostly due to the poor characterization. All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason. Even Tess and Colin's development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced. The writing does improve towards the end but it's not enough to save the book. Unless you have your heart set on reading all of the books in the series, skip this one."
"1","ADDONICS PORTABLE CD DRIVE - I am disappointed in its performance","I am disappointed in its performance. It seems underpowered and is constantly trying to read CDs, half the time unsuccessfully. I am going to try to return it to Amazon."
"1","Too Uncomfortable and Too Big","These pants were way too big (looked about 2 sizes larger), and they were incredibly stiff. They would have been very uncomfortable for my daughter to wear all day."
"2","Very authentic","This is my first encounter with Yoruba and I have to say that CDs are really helping. However, the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances - for someone who NEVER spoke Yoruba and doesn't have anybody to ask for a clue, it leaves a lot of questions unanswered - for this, however, there are hopefully other Yoruba textbooks.On the brighter note, I would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on Yoruba people and Yoruba culture in general. I would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn Yoruba - you can't go wrong with it."
"1","Not the best","I agree, the CDs are a much needed help, since it would be impossible to pronnounce the Yoruba tones without the help of a native speaker. However, the design of the book is really poor and confusing. I have found several spealling mistakes in English and Yoruba. And the grammar explanations are very hard to understand.Unfortunately there are not many Teach Yourself Yoruba books that are worth it. This one at least provides basic vocabulary and pronounciation skills."
"1","Doesn't Fit","I ordered this DashMat for a specific vehicle, it was not the correct mat. I returned the original one and they sent me an exact duplicate of the wrong mat. I can't seem to get the correct one and therefore it sits in a box!!!!!!"
"2","You need a good memory","I play this with my grandchildren. It teaches us both the value of a good memory and is challenging for all. You sometimes miss the most obvious. Lots of fun--tic tac toe with a twist!"
"2","Kelly Club Pet Parade at HIT!! My Daughter Loves IT!!","My 4 year old daughter LOVES this game. She sings the ""Strike Up The Band and Clap Your Hands for Kelly's Pet Parade!"" song around the house. She can dress the Kelly kids, ""train"" each pet (teach the pony to jump, etc.), clean and get the animals ready for the parade (paint the elephant's toe nails, etc.), and decorate the floats...all by herself. She'll get everything ready (showing me everything she has accomplished along the way) and then we'll watch her special parade. A wonderfully cute game that I highly recommend.She can mostly do the entire game on her own. I have it installed on a laptop so she is actually using the inset mouse and can still do the game. The only one she has a tough time with is the Polar Bear catching fish game. It's tricky to move your finger on the mouse pad and click at the same time to catch the fish. It would be much easier using a regular mouse."
"2","Loads of fun!","My 6-year old and 5-year old both really enjoy this game. Has lots to do with several different animals to prepare for the parade. You get to design a float and it just endless fun! Graphics and animation are very colorful and cute. It's a winner!"
"1","easy and fun for 3-4yr olds","fun easy game if you can keep it from freezing. I've reinstalled it and done everything I know to do to correct the issue. It's a shame my 4yr old really likes it."
"2","Hours of Fun for my 4 and 6 year olds","We purchased this game a year ago and my girls still love to play it. Lot's of activities, they love to decorate the floats and watch the parade."
"2","slip on 2 1/2 in. heel shoes","i am completely satisfied in the manner my order was delivered.the shoes are just as awesome as the advertisement showed them to be."
"2","DDR is cooool!","This cd is really great.BUT ITS NOT A GAME!they're not long versons though, only 90 odd seconds each.If that Claire, also from the UK (who was disappointed with the cd) wants to get in touch, i know where you can get games with the songs you want.I'm assuming you're after all the cool songs from euromix.If so, they are on 2nd and 3rd mix games from japan.but there are also US versions available too."
"2","Amazing","i have ordered this cd of here but it will take abit to get to me as i live in England. But i have danced and sang along to it at the arcades ive been to and i think its great if you love to dance. My favorite songs are what a feeling and in the navey!! i also like captain jack but i love them all.."
"1","I got fooled...","I did not know this was the audio cd of the game, I thought it could be used on the playstation. Maybe the other guys are from the US or somewhere where it is actually easy to get the game,and play it,but this was all in japanese and was not compatible with my machine. I am deeply disappointed as i love the arcade game, but the Dance stage euromix (Dance Dance Revolution equivalent) is lacking in decent tracks, many are jungle-y and are difficult to dance to them. Also, most of these tracks are unheard of here and are therefore not very enjoyable. However, my favourite are Keep on moving, make a Jam, and Video Killed the Radio star. But it gets a bit pedantic if you keep playing on these tracks. If anyone is in the same situation as I am, or those of you who are lucky enough the play on the newest version, can you please let me know where I can order one? I am in dance deprivation/boredom!"

"2","MORE THAN LETTERS...","I admit that I bought this album for the title track alone. After all, had that been the only good track on this CD I still would have felt that it was worth my money.But the title track is just the beginning for this fine country offering by John Michael Montgomery. I found myself listening to and enjoying every track on LETTERS FROM HOME. Montgomery's smoother-than-silk voice is one of the finest in country music today and his straight-forward approach to his music comes through in every note. You won't want to miss this one.THE HORSEMAN"
"2","Worth the wait!","JMM has never released a bad album. Many would say this is a comeback album but every couple of years he releases an album with great hits. For some reason, radio hasn't played some of his great songs from his latest albums. ""Goes Good With Beer"" and ""Little Devil"" would be great singles to spice up country radio. ""Letters From Home"" deserves to be single of the year and ""Cool"" is not far behind. The more I listen to the album, the more I love it."
"1","letters from home","i like letters from home cuz it tells a story that if you really listen you can acctually hear john michael montgomery tell his story of soldiers and all that stuffi liked it and i like punk rock and rock so it must be good if i like it"
"2","no good","I gave it 5 stars because my little dog had so much fun riping it apart but only took him 24 hrs to do it buy that is 23 hrs longer than other balls"

"2","Oh!","This cereal is so sweet....yet so good for you! One taste=ADDICTION!!!! I just tried this cereal out of curiousity and I was hooked! It is an excellent breakfast choice, or just any time to eat! Especially as breakfast because you will crave more honey taste and you won't be hungry later {probably because of how much you'd eat} and it is actually sweeter and better than Honey Bunches of Oats. Cap'n Crunch Berries is an option, but this splendid cereal is SO FILLED WITH A HONEY-FILLED TASTE! I have not tried much better tasting cereal than this! Oh!"
"2","Delicious and Addictive","This cereal is great because it tastes so good. You just crave it. But a word of warning: read the label. Last time my husband and I looked, it had saturated fat! All the other cereals in our cabinet did not... hmmmm. Another reviewer noticed this problem too!Also, Amazon's price of $23 is outrageous. It is between $1.99 to $2.50 in our stores."
"2","Oh where Oh where have my Oh's gone?","I was really distraught to go to my local Walmart and see that they stopped carrying my favorite cereal. But as was elated to find that ""the site who has everything including a church"" made it available to me by the 6-pack. Oh's is an amazing cereal. The one thing i dont like is the box is so small. I get maybe 3 bowls out of the entire box:-(."
"2","One of a kind book for timber frame building.","My husband loves this book. He said he has learned so much and that this was the best book to learn how to build a timber frame house by."
"1","no technical information","this book is a great over view of the joints used in building but has no information on beam spans or loads to actually build a building"
"2","Hanford Mills museum","My friend is a master carpenter and he saw this book at a recent trip to Hanford Mills museum.He is an avid reader and loved the book so much that I am inclined to read it as well!! Enjoy."
"1","you will not be able to buils a timber frame house","This book vaguely breezed across history and went into various types of timber structures. The mortise and tenon joints that were illustrated were fascinating but not practical for a home builder."
"2","Outstanding guidebook for building your own timberframe home","My wife and I built a hybrid timber frame home using this book as a guide. Although we have construction skills, this book was invaluable in guiding us through the process. We can't wait to build another. We highly recommend this book to anyone considering a timber frame house."
"1","Excellent book, very poor e-book editing","Yet another example of an superb book done a serious disservice by e-book publishers.Multiple spelling errors, improperly placed figures & captions, whole sections of the book written in CAPS for some reason.If you are looking for an excellent reference on traditional timber framing, look no further, but please pick up the print version instead of the e-book."
"2","A very good how-to manual.","If you are expecting a book full of glossy sharp pictures, this is not the one to buy.A lot of drawings and BW pictures that inform what they need to. This is a very good manual for those who want to venture in a timber frame project."
"1","Poor instructions, but once you figure it out... kinda cool","These wraps were not doing anything when we placed them in ""hot"" water. We searched the internet and found others having the same problem. The instructions are very poor. First off, you need to dip in boiling water (or at least some temperature level above what I would call hot). Second, the instructions don't describe what should happen, should the image shrink around the egg, transfer to it -- what?Needless to say, it was frustrating for a minute or two, but my wife - who is very intelligent and great in the kitchen - immediately thought, ""well... hot water wouldn't do much to change the properties of the plastic, so let's try boiling water - nothing to lose.""Should be more explicit in the instructions. (We were using the star wars version of this product)."
"2","Great Graphics!","2006 Coast to Coast for PC is great! The graphics are awesome... The game is what I had hoped for and a lot more!!"
"1","Dont run out to get Outrun unless your from 1985","Outrun was the biggest disappointment of my holidays.If you've just come home from a life in 1985 you might enjoy this. I read the reviews before buying but it didn't sink in what Arcade style meant. I am an addicted follower of Colin MacRea rally and thought to race a ferrari across the US would be cool. I was wrong. The games is to car racing what space invaders is to ""Battlefield"". The landscape moves instead of the car and you have these idiotic stages like impress your girlfriend with how many slides you can do. Total rubbish. Not anyones fault but mine, but I live in Ireland and got it shipped through Florida so it is a costly mistake."
"2","My Henry","I had Henry back in the 70's. I don't remember him with a nose since it was chewed off, but he was well loved. He's long gone and I thought I was the only one who ever had a Henry since nobody knew what I was talking about. I can't believe I've found him again!! Nobody can replace my original worn Henry, but I'm so excited to have his clone back!!"
"2","Henry has come home...","I had Henry back in the early 70's. I am forty now and still have my original. I bought a new one for my Dad who is ill because I knew he would get the significance. Henry got me through the insecurities I had as a child and I am hoping he does the same for my Dad as he battles terminal cancer.Thanks for making him again."
"2","Charisma","What it is about ""Henry Dog"". My daughter was 6 when we gave her Henry. Love is not the word. Obsession! A few years later my ex-wife decided he had to go. Under the guise of an ""incurable"" lice infection my ex-wife threw him out. Trauma followed. We bought a replacement which my daughter has safely on her closet shelf. He is thread bare. I found him online and was overwhelmed to read the reviews at Amazon.com. None had less than 5 stars. Each story told how this little guy had touched their lives. These Henry owners, both girls and boys, cherished him as if he had been a ""real"" dog. I guess to them, he is. Daddy had to buy his little (40 year old) daughter a new one. I got both the 14"" and 3"". I was on the phone when she opened the box..... Henry was home again. My granddaughter saw Henry got excited and wanted one also. She is 19 years old. This company should bottle ""Henry Dog`s"" charisma. Thanks for keeping him alive."
"2","I found it! Henry Dog!","I had two Henry Dogs. One I lost in a ride at Walt Disney World, the second to replace it. I have no idea where Henry got to. But now that I found ""him"", I will have my friend again. I had this toy from the time I was six years old, almost 40 years ago, and I think I'll be seeing him again around Christmas time. It's a sweeet toy and really good for children of *all* ages!"
"2","A Contemporary Fairytale Sure to Delight!","While this book is a take-off on the classic Snow White, it's a fairytale for grown ups with some class act characters and a rich and rewarding love story. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, and look forward to more of Ms. Sinclair's works."
"1","Not Patterns - but Detailed Sketches","Although I was excited to purchase this book, my excitement didn't last when I looked at the sketches / pictures in the book. I call them pictures because that is what they truly are, not actual patterns. Norma Gregory's talent shows up well in her designs but due to their complicated rendering they are very difficult to transfer.This book is not for beginners - but more seasoned artisans.If you are looking for patterns, like I was, you will be disappointed in this book."
"2","great gift","my brother in law was thrilled with the clarity and instructional commentswill be looking for more titles by her"
"1","Product didn't match the picture/description","Unless they sent me the wrong product by mistake, the foot cushion picture and description does not match the item delivered. I was under the impression I would receive two (a pair) of water filled foot cushions that I could insert into my shoes. Instead I received ONE foot cushion, filled with another material (not water) that you attach to your foot via a toe strap. I was definately not happy with the item and sent it back for a refund. Luckily for me Amazon has a great return policy... they make returns very easy!"
"1","Good for a laugh","I heard about this book, so I wanted to read it to see if it was as funny and stupid (unintentionally) as I heard.I was not disappointed. Few things in life are free, and sex is defintely not among them.The perfect coda to this book is that the couple got divroced several years after publishing this book. You can't make this stuff up."
"1","As Bad a Production as Possible","This Broadway Theatre Archive production took one of the wittiest, most sparkling 18th-century comedies--and ruined it. The costumes are intentionally absurd (think Beach Blanket Babylon), the acting is way over-the-top-camp, and the incidental music could not be worse. The music, BTW, is a combination of pop Renaissance and pop modern; anything but 18th century. The director appears to have had the goal of showing that his company was just too hip and too modern to do anything but make fun of this silly, fusty old play.I like ""The School for Scandal"" very much, and not having found any other DVDs of it, I started out with the intention of keeping a recording of even a bad production. But when they got into the extended bop-be-bop of the drinking song scene, I knew I just couldn't ever sit through this one again.The visuals are also blurry, but with the production being so bad, so what? Anyone who actually likes this play will be revolted by this DVD."
"1","Not professional quality","I first tried buying this tape from a Marketplace seller. I sent it back because the tape quality was poor and the packaging looked unprofessional. After returning it I bought one from Amazon proper and . . . it was the same quality tape and the same packaging. Since I'm now sure this is not a bootleg tape, all I can say is . . . some videos are better than others."
"1","three to four stars - depending...","Classic drawing room comedy, period piece. Cleverly written in a time when the audience needed a bit of a nudge to figure out each character. Each person's name describes how you should feel about each! Charming idea from the 1700's. If you've never had a chance to see one of these comedies, take a look. This is a famous play and well done. Must see for theatre students."
"1","Good songs, bad cover.","This CD compilation set was purchased for me. I love the 80s, and they chose great songs. The songs are not performed by the original artists. Instead, they're poorly covered by ""the Starlite Singers""."
"1","New Wave 80s","I should have read the prior reviews of this record before buying it. Although it appears to be a collection of new wave singles from the 80s, these are just cover versions sung by the ""Starlite Singers"". The description of the record says that it is by ""various artists"" implying that they are by the original artists, but this is not true. Total garbage. The one bright spot is that I got a prompt refund when I returned it."
"1","Don't Be Fooled!","I bought this set last November and just now decided to listen to the CDs. Nowhere in the description on Amazon does it say not the original artists! In fact, it says various artists, which is deceiving because only one group performs all the songs. It leads one to believe original artists when it says various artists because it is, after all, a compilation of music by various artists! Duh! So, don't waste your money. I will probably throw these in the trash as I'm a purist and I want original, not wedding reception music!"
"1","Buyers Beware!!!!!!!!!","This is one of those cheesy compilations where they find session bands and similar sounding artists to sing the songs. These are NOT ORIGINAL SONGS BY THE ARTISTS. If you loved K-TEL CD's and don't care about hearing the artists originals, and don't care about cheap sounding synthesizers playing the music or that fact that some of the vocalists are pretty bad, then you might like this cd. But if you are a fan of the 80's and the amazing music it produced, then buy other collections and don't waste your money on this schlock!!!!"
"2","Sony basic Hi8 Handycam Rocks!","Performance is outstanding. I had a previous Sony 8 mm Handycam which died and I replaced it with this camera so I could continue to playback my old 8 mm tapes. This camera performs faster and is simpler to use than my old Sony. It does everything I need and does it well... I got a great deal."
"1","BEWARE!!","Bought this camera for Christmas. Had her open it first so she could film the nights party & NO TAPES ARE INCLUDED! Of course all stores are closed Christmas day so the thing is USELESS until the day after. Shame on Sony. How much would a tape included in the packace cost them ? Not included Battery chargers are ...."
"2","80's High Tech with Rock Emotion","Although all of Mr Hines work is high quality, Waving Not Drowning (for me) is the highlight of the 3 A&M projects. The song ""Curious Kind"" is simply a masterpiece!The remastering is of the quality you have come to expect from one of Rock's greatest producers, song writers, and performers.GET IT!"
"1","Never gets going","This book never really seems to get going. There is too much time spent in the courtroom while basic questions about the crime and the suspect/defendant are left unasked.After 200 pages, I realized that this book wasn't going to pick up or reveal any crucial information to make sense out of things until the very end.As a result, the whole story rapped up very quickly in an unbelievable way and you are left wondering why no one could figure anything out earlier. Based on the ending, the detectives and attorneys appear rather incompetent.I did enjoy parts of the book, however, and I think the plot needs to be unfolded at a different rate (not so slow in the beginning and not so fast at the end). I am a McBain fan and think that some of his other books are better written."
"2","Now, The Rest of the Story","I knew there was something missing from the first book when I read it, because it didn't match what I heard her say years ago when she came to my church to speak. Now I know, the abuse was so difficult for her to talk about even when she wrote a book about it. Later, with the help of a trusted friend, she was able to tell the most difficult and abusive parts of her childhood experience. This what the second book is about. The most wonderful thing about Dorie, is that she is able to forgive her abusers and move on with her life. She is still able to have a successful and happy life, in spite of the horrendous abuse of her childhood. This is what so many women need to hear. With the Lord's help, it is possible!"
"2","The baseball benchmark","I didn't refer to Baseball America as such. It was Cardinals GM Walt Jocketty who said it. And who am I to contradict? The best columnists in the game, from Peter Gammons, Tracy Ringolsby and Jayson Stark, to detailed information in ALL of baseball, from the Major Leagues to Japan, stats, scores, and the best and most extensive resource on prospect information, there's not a single serious fan in all of baseball who deserves such a title if is not a Baseball America subscriber. You got to read it if you want to know the stars of tomorrow (being tomorrow 6 years or 2 months). Top 10 prospects from every team till its massive Top 100 list, Baseball America covers it all. I know, I have been subscribed for 2 years now, and I can't think of living without it!"
"2","Perfect for the die-hard baseball fan","I have read Baseball America off and on over the years and finally took the plunge and got a subscription. This is the best place to get coverage of the minors, college, and high school baseball so you know about the top prospects before others do."
"1","""Uh oh he's been using Brand X""","An embarassment. Steer clear of this one folks. Just when you thought these guys were the last real ""fusion"" types about...Since when did the last great secret of the fusion world start taking pointers from Joe Satriani and listening to old Al DiMeola pratice sessions? Where the hell is Phil when you need him, oh yes, Tarzan. The star is for the Bruford and Wilding/Bonus tracks, and well does one really want those?"
"2","This was an intriguing book that influenced my destiny.","I read ""Trouble on Titan"" around 1970, when the Apollo program was at its apex, and the human exploration of the Solar System seemed only a short step away. My review is based on old memories, but I can still remember a mining colony on Titan and jet craft using oxygen for fuel and burning Titan's methane atmosphere. We've learned much since this book was written, and Titan's atmosphere has less methane than we originally thought. However, this book was well written, and I am sure will intrigue my son as much as it intrigued his father, who is now working at NASA on the Cassini/Huygens mission to Saturn and Titan. This book has that old-style sci-fi flavor that made another world seem more like reality than fantasy. I think if you enjoyed the Lucky Starr and David Starr stories by Asimov, you will enjoy ""Trouble on Titan."""
"2","Peek a Fun!","We got these as a gift for our one year old. He loves them! He tries very hard to get all the little things out of the blocks - and obviously fails. He loves that some of them move, some of them jiggle, some of them make noise - its almost an adventure!The three year old also loves them because they incorporate the alphabet and he can easily identify the items inside: B - Banana, P - Penguin, U - Umbrella, Z - Zebra.Bonus - when the 1 y/o gets frustrated because he can't pry the items out of the block no matter how hard he tries, he usually flings them. The 3 y/o tends to use them to build walls or towers for the sole purpose of smashing another toy into them, or dropping them off high places. And I've stepped on two of them already. They seem to tolerate this treatment rather well."
"2","Excellent product","These Alphabet blocks are so beautiful they could be classed as works of art or collectors items. I have purchased two seys as gifts and will probably buy more,"
"1","Great for Twins","I purchased the Alphabet blocks for my twin daughters. They are just over 8 months old and they love them. This product is a great learning tool for them for years to come but for now it a great teething toy!!! I would recommend this to anyone, plus I love Fisher Price."
"2","They're blocks - keep that in mind","We got these after seeing the Incrediblocks in the FP Catalog.There are little to no pizazz to the blocks. Some have features where you can ""spin"" them (like the letter Q - Queen) or the W (watermelon seeds that rattle) - but most are just a ""look at me"" type of a block.With that in mind - yes I like the product. They're blocks. They're meant for stacking, knocking over and banging - which my son loves (he's had these since he was 6 months). They're better than the plain wooden blocks because they're textured, they have objects inside, letters - lots of opportunities to learn letters, colors, objects, descriptions, etc.For now he's stacking, banging and knocking over. It'll be around for a while until he's ready to learn more words, colors, objects, animals. This review isn't profound or eye openings because again - they're just blocks. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. It will not make your child an overnight rocket scientist =)"
"1","Would have expected better!","I bought these for two reasons- blocks and educational letters. However, the letters are rubbing off. For the price I paid that was dissapointing. Other than that I love the concept and the objects inside are fun."
"2","Cute gift for a little baby","Although I felt it looked a bit chinsy, the mother had it on her wish list and was very happy to receive them."
"2","Great Blocks","My daughter loves her blocks. She will get them all out and look at each one until she finds her favorite. She likes to shake them and see what each one does. These are cute little blocks that have hours of imaginative playtime inside. They also have blunt corners, so no sharp edges like wood blocks for the safety of smaller children. The fact that they have the letters of the alphabet and a corresponding object inside makes them a great learning tool even for older tots. We have really enjoyed these and recommend them to our friends."
"2","Awesume! BEST BLOCKS EVER!","THIS TOY WAS OUR GRANDSON'S FAVORITE, SO I JUST HAD TO FIND IT AGAIN FOR OUR NEWEST GRANDCHILD. THANK GOODNESS FOR ONLINE SHOPPING."
"2","keeps his attention","My little boy is just getting interested in these blocks. They are too cute! He's learning to manipulate the block in his hands. The little things inside the blocks are adorable. Some spin, some twirl, some rock. A definate upgrade from the standard wooden blocks."
"2","Great value.","This set incorporates a lot of the favorites from other sets packaged in an A to Z learning format. I have been leary of purchasing too many of these blocks for storage reasons so the zippered case is a great bonus. Definitely worth every penny."
"2","Wonderful but not worth $80.","These are great blocks but they are definitely not worth the listed $79.99. They can be purchsed for about $20 many other places."
"2","Worth the investment","This is a great set of blocks. I researched different blocks for some time and found these to be the most durable, age and developmentally-appropriate, and highly-educational. $25 bucks may seem like a lot, but I think it is well worth it. I am very impressed with the quality.The size and shape of the blocks is just right. My son is 5-months old and he is able to hold the blocks perfectly in his little hands. PLUS, the blocks do not have sharp corners (like the wooden blocks also available on this site) that could hurt your little one (especially those of you with chewers!).One category that I rated this toy with only a 4 (instead of 5) is the ""fun"" factor. For younger babies that may not ""get it"" yet, this toy may not be as fun for them until they are a little bit older. My son is not yet able to fully comprehend that there are even toys inside the blocks, but then again he is only 5 months. Give him a couple of months and he'll really dig them!"
"1","waste off money","this is not waterproof.its GARBAGE where batteries go in broke,while trying to adj.DO NOT BUY.you turn the end to control it,that loosens the battery cover where water gets in so how is it waterproff?????"
"2","California Exotics Waterproof Delights Blue Ballsy","The California Exotics Waterproof Delights Blue Ballsy,is to spice up the relationship and it worked since the beginning,my other half likes it."
"1","small didn't work","It is very small compared to what i thought it would be, but even so it didn't work when we got it"
"2","Makes for fascinating reading.","Whale naturalist and animal communicator Mary Getten goes beyond what other research has achieved in the way of whale study and communication processes: in 1991 she studied the J-Pod, a family of whales off Washington State. Her contention that they use direct telepathic communication between themselves and can do so with humans also makes for fascinating reading.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
"2","Pretty Nifty!","I purchased these for a Halloween party, and then...like a dummy, I forgot to put them up! Nevertheless, I did hold them up around the house in search of a good place to hang them. They're pretty big and look really cool. I'd say there's a little bit of educational value too, as you can teach your children about the actual pictures they're depicting. Even though I forgot to hang them up, I really liked these scene setters and I'll be using them next year!"
"1","Yet another unsubstantiated case....","While I believe in discrimination, I certainly can't believe what is in this book. It is an unsubstantiated smear campaign to rally the troups in higher ed to claw again for the preservation of academic freedom- a rally which falls flat."
"1","Molly Myers","Molly Myers, in her review of ""My Name is Rachel Corrie,"" describes the ISM as ""an organization dedicated to non-violence."" This is radical left-wing propaganda: ISM offices have regularly been used to hide terrorists and their weapons, ISM ""pacifists"" regularly throw rocks at IDF soldiers, and they're perfectly willing to use violence in order to sabotage the wall intended to keep ""innocent Palestinians"" from murdering Israelis.So please disregard Molly's reviews; they are biased in the extreme."
"1","Gardening lawn book","Four pages of the book was missing. It just happened to be the formulas that my husband needed. Fortunately he was able to copy our friends book. But I will hesitate to buy another book like this again."
"1","It's a knock off.","The official Chrono Trigger OST has 3 discs. This version has some of the major tracks on it, the audio quality is good, but Caveat Emptor (buyer beware) this is a Chinese knock-off.Oh and if you buy the 3 disc version, make sure the cover does not have a green and red logo reading ""FX"", for this is also a counterfeit. The serial numbers on the real soundtrack CDs are PSCN-5021, PSCN-5022, and PSCN-5023."
"1","Just a few.","These are the handful of tracks we hear over and over again. It's far from complete though.Missing such memorable tracks as ""sealed Door"", ""wings across time"" or ""At the Bottom of the Night"".It doesn't have a single battle theme accept the final boss.Hell this doesn't even have Lucca's theme and she's on the cover!Had I seen a track-list beforehand I wouldn't have bought this.I blame my self for not being more curious of the number of CD's.I'm sorry I paid $35 dollars American for this travesty, may Lavos have mercy on my soul.Save your selves(and your money) while you still can!"
"1","It was ""ok"" but I won't watch it again","I watched this last night. And I don't remember enough of it to give it a indepth review. But it wasn't as bad as people are letting on nor was it as great as people are letting on. If you don't like your killer to be supernatural then don't bother with this. Its about a guy that comes back from the dead. His whole storyline is kinda silly and there are plot holes all over the place. The acting wasn't bad at all, and neither were the deaths. In fact it was kinda gory. But that doesn't make a great movie. The flashbacks were a little confusing as well. I wouldn't watch it again. But its far from the worst movie I've seen."
"2","Loved it! (P.S. Stephen Colletti is so hot!)","I initially bought the movie just because Stephen Colletti (who I'm in love with) was one of the leads...and I really didn't expect much from what looks to be a low-budget indie horror flick. But, I really did like it! The lead girl who plays Jennifer (Nikki DeLoach) is really good. I can't believe I've never seen her in anything before? Maybe I have, but I didn't know!?! It was cool to see the guy from Weekend at Bernie's (Terry Kiser)...he is a really good actor. Too bad he was dead the whole time in both movies I saw him in, lol. Anyways, this was a cool movie and I'm glad I got it!"
"2","mask maker","It was good horrifying never a dull moment u can watch and not be bored ir wondering when is a good part coming"
"2","mask maker","I liked the film it has what every horror likes in this type of movie the suspense,mystery,good and bad times,plus a shocking ending that makes you think that there is more to story, and plot was very good Robert."
"2","NOT the worst American B-Movie","This movie was a horror film thhat displayed an effort to steer clear of typical horror movie dialogue and pacing. There are no blonde girls and the girls that are here don`t trip over the tree roots in the yard. Now a white girl did fall and twist her knee in the movie but guess what? It was not on a tree root!!!"
"1","MASK OF FAMILIARITY","MASK MAKER takes us down a cinematic path often traveled and does it in a typically predictable fashion. A story of revenge with an unstoppable killer who murders his victims and uses their skinned faces to achieve some kind of beauty. Flashbacks reveal his motivation in an attempt to elicit some level of sympathy.MASK MAKER isn't the worst entry in this familiar territory but it doesn't tread new waters either. The cast performs on various levels of competence. WEEKEND AT BERNIE's Terry Kiser is an effective guilt-ridden buffoon. Treat Williams is ill-used in a cameo role. Horror vet Michael Berryman is unusually restrained in a small role. Nikki Deloach is no Jamie Lee Curtis in her leading role, giving a weak performance in a typical survivor role as the resilient resourceful female. Doomed fiance Stephen Colletti (sic) is equally flaccid.An open-ended finale paves the way for MASK MAKER II---something we definitely don't need."
"1","Unmasked..................","Sadly, there is absolutely nothing original in this movie. The filmmakers shamelessly borrowed from practically everyone, turning out a stale formula piece that is purely by the numbers. I couldn't find a thing that elevated this movie above a 100 other like films. The plot is standard: a group of kids spend the weekend at an old house with a bad history. A standard, run of the mill maniac kills them in unimaginative ways and of course no one notices until it's too late. Everything happens exactly on cue, in order, with no surprises, and no frights. This movie is safe and boring, it really couldn't have been any better if it tried. Not even the brief appearance of horror icon Michael Berryman (playing a nice guy for a change) can help the dullness of the script.Even the title is a misnomer! Although the original title, Maskerade, isn't any better.And I had such high hopes as this is one of my favorite genres."
"2","A museum exhibit inside a book","This book was in my library's Genealogy section, and you're not allowed to take Genealogy books out of the library. But I liked it enough to sit in the library and read it, in two sittings.This a quick read, because it has loads of pictures: photos of the ghetto and its inhabitants, and also pictures of artifacts such as ration cards, work certificates, yellow stars, etc. It's more like a museum exhibit than a simple book. Because of the format I think young people would be able to get something out of the book too, although it is clearly written for adults. Certainly it probably has the most information on the Kovno/Kaunas ghetto all in one place.Both researchers and the ordinary person interested in the Holocaust would enjoy this.Bonus: pages from the diary of Ilya Gerber are printed in this book; you can read extracts from the diary in Alexandra Zapruder'sSalvaged Pages: Young Writers' Diaries of the Holocaust."
"2","Great resource for Chinese/Eastern medincine","This is an excellent book to have as a reference fo eastern methodologies in medicine and healing. Unfortunately it is long out of print, but if you can get your hands on a copy of this text, you will not be dissappointed. In fact, if you are unhappy with it, I will be happy to purchase it from you as I have many peers that would happily use it."
"2","Why Is This A Good Book?","As someone who has been practicing Chinese Medicine for 16 years in San Diego (www.bodymindwellnesscenter.com), I find this book an excellent resource for anyone who wants and in dept primer into the theoretical basis and practical application of a system of medicine that originates in the Chinese philosophy that emphasizes the natural balance found in Nature and agriculture."
"2","A Book That Is Worth a Second Look","This book is great. It is very informative. It is easy to read and understand and has alot of pictures. i would recommend this book for any one wanting to learn about Chinese Medicine."
"2","Best game ever","This games makes even amazing games like starcraft and warcraft redundant. Warhammer has it all and does it better than anyone else. Truly great game, total fun, great combat, graphics, races, units, a pleasure to play."
"1","Guitar in Absentia","With all due respect to ambient music enthusiasts, I was really disappointed that there was no guitar work whatsoever on this album. Hillage fans of L and Fish Rising be forewarned.Steve Hillage was a pretty darn good guitarist. Maybe L was his showcase with members of Todd Rundgren's Utopia backing him up.Noting that other reviewers have rated this highly, I will give it another listen. However, I am dissapointed in the direction Steve has taken his music."
"1","Stiff and Smells like drying paint","You get what you pay for. This pillow is stiff and smelled like drying paint for 4 days. I thought I was getting a non name brand version of the Temperpedic pillow. I bought the real pillow for my mother years ago and paid many times the price. This thing doesn't even come close."
"1","Review of Pillow","This was a joke. I am sending the pillow back. Does not come close to what was advertised. I believe the cardboard box that it arrived in would have been softer under my head. I am giving it one star just so I can post this. I only wish the stars could go negative."
"1","Don't bother","The pillow is tiny and poor quality foam, my pillow I was replacing was at least a year and a half old and it preforms better than this one did new."
"1","Worthless and cheap","How is this thing awful? let me count the ways..First off, it took an unatural amount of time to get here. Whatever, that happens.It feels super cheap. When you handle a good memory foam pillow, it feels heavy and cushy in your hands. This thing feels like a piece of hard styrofoam. It barely squishes at all and has no 'memory', it is simply a very dense foam pillow. It's not even really a pillow- It's so hard that I cant even use it for propping my back whilst reading.On top of that, their terrible return pollicies make it not worth returning.DO NOT BUY! Just use the styrofoam your new computer came in.Ugh."
"1","Will not be purchasing another one of these","It worked fine in the beginning. 2 months or so into using it its performance was up in the air. I would find myself sleeping with one hand under the pillow to give it some leverage; otherwise my neck would end up in an awkward position. At times it felt like I needed to have 2 pillows because it was lacking in width and was too soft. I had to also rotate what end and what side I would lay my head/neck on. It, therefore, did not provide the support I needed."
"1","False Advertisement","The pillow I received is nothing like the one in the picture. The pillow that I received is approx half the size (in thickness) as the one I received. I am not happy with the seller (Moshelle's). I will never purchase from this company ever again. I am currently deployed Military and I feel that this company is very disrespectful and does not show it's Military members the proper courtesy when dealing with such issues. Do not buy this pillow, you will not be satisfied."
"1","Not Like the Old Formula","The formulation of this product has been changed since Artec was bought by L'Oreal. The new formula doesn't hold hair like the old Artec original formula did, and it doesn't smell as nice. Don't be fooled by this picture (12/29/07)--it is a pic of the old Artec bottle, but I ordered and received the new L'Oreal Professionel version, which is terrible. The original Artec version was similar to, but not as sticky as, Potion 9. I wish L'Oreal would go back to the old formula :( I emailed them to this effect and they never even replied. If anyone can recommend a similar product, please comment to this review."
"2","haven't found better yet...","This is the only product that can manage my hair without making it stiff or sticky."
"2","smoothing serum","The product is wonderful for my hair which is very curly and tends to be frizzy. Smooths it and gets rid of allof the friz. Use it once a day, even in damp weather"
"1","The product I received this time is like fake one","I have been used this product for many years. But somehow the product I received this time is like fake one. It's very thin. I have to used double amount."
"1","If it ain't broke don't fix it","I have been using this product for 5+ years. It was wonderful. About 1 year ago the company changed packaging and the product changed slightly. The bottle is taller now and something is missing from the serum. Doesn't work as well as it used to work. I will not be purchasing this item because of the change."
"1","Review of Artec Textureline Smoothing Serum","I ordered this particular product as a trial substitute for the ""Controlgel"" by Textureline, which has always been my first choice. It appears that the ""Controlgel"" is out of production. This ""Smoothing Serum"" is a poor substitute. My barber agrees. He got me on the ""Controlgel"" years ago and I used to buy extra for him, but now, no more!! Too bad . . . we consumers lose again. I wish the ""Controlgel"" product would come back. My barber and I won't buy any more of the ""Smoothing Serum."" What a WASTE!!"
"2","LOVE IT!","I just got this from a local Stop and Shop and LOVE it! It leaves my hair so soft, smelling good and you can't even tell that I have any product in my hair. I'm reading a lot of reviews where people are saying that they can't find it anywhere. Depending on where you live, try your local grocery store!"
"2","The Best !!!!","Dick Curless has got the most beautiful voice I have ever heard. His music ranges from thought provoking, to toe tapping, beer drinking music. One of his best renditions is Winter's Coming On Again. People who appreciate good music from any genre will love this CD. I can not recommend it highly enough."
"2","Great control racquet","A great racquet for anyone, although it is better suited for the more advanced player. For years, I played with the OS version of this racquet which is noticeably more powerful and is a little more forgiving than the MS version. At this point, I prefer the MS version more just because of the better control and feel.Even now, the Prince Graphite (OS or MS) is still a great racquet, and IMO, one of the best control racquets ever made."
"1","DO NOT BUY, A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!!","My daughter wanted this for a few months before I finally gave in and bought it for her. She was so excited. We got home and played it for one hour hoping that something different or better would happen. The game was so so boring. You get to choose music, outfits, and which of the three skaters to skate. That is IT. Everything else is controlled automatically by the game. Barbie does everything perfectly whether you do or not. My daughter hasn't played it since and is so disapointed in it. The store I bought it from won't let me return it because it has been opened. They will let me exchange it for the exact same game but hello that is the problem. This game was a waste of time and money."
"1","Bad skating technique","I didn't buy this game, becuase I can tell by the pictures that Barbie has very bad skating technique (see below). This game is not for kids who want to have fun while seeing a good skating program.Pictures on Amazon1) Box picture -- I can't tell whether or not Barbie is stroking or doing a bad spiral? Either her leg is too high if she is stroking, or her body and leg are not in the right position if she is doing a spiral.2) Layback -- Although it's hard to see, it looks like Barbie might be spinning on her toe pick.3) Split jump -- Barbie does not have enough skating muscle for the jump. She is also not kicking her boots up.Pictures on vugames (makers of the game)1) Stroking -- Barbie's body is crooked. She doesn't have her weight over her stroking leg, and her body is leaning to the side. I've never seen anyone stroke like this."
"1","A complete waste","My daughter received this cd for Christmas. It is very slow loading lots of wait time for things to happen. When she finally chose the skater and where she should skate (only one choice worked), my daughter kept asking what she could do now. Most of the time we were watching Barbie skate beautifully. Not very interactive. I consider this a waste of space on my computer, a waste of time for us to use. I would recommend saving your money and get something worthwhile."
"1","4 year old BORED with this after 2 weeks","I bought this for my 4 year old's birthday. While I think the graphics are really great, the concept stinks. My daughter told me she thinks it is boring (and she LOVES Barbie) and last night she even said she hates it! At least my 15 month old screams with delight at the graphics when her older sister plays with it."
"1","Barbie's Boring Ice Show","I bought this game because I am a figure skating fan and found the Barbie Gymnastics to be well done, so I thought that this would be too. It was an absolute waste of money. The graphics are awful and the game play is far too simplistic. There is nothing to strive for in the game and it is too easy to pass onto the next level. I can't imagine a child above the age of 3 or 4 getting any enjoyment from this game."
"1","WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! BARBIE HAS SUNK TO NEW LOWS","This is the WORST CD-ROM game I have ever seen! My 7-year-old daughter longed for this game all Christmas season and she is bored out of her mind with it after one hour. It is slow, skippy, etc. running on a new computer! Don't waste your money like we did, skip right over this dud."
"2","IT'S GREAT!","All the other reviews say this product is boring and ""save your money""....Well my daughter & I LOVE IT!You get to pick one of three pretty girl skaters, You pick her one of, AT LEAST 15 costumes. Somebody said the skater ""never falls""?? Thats boloney. She falls plenty until you develope the hand eye coordination this FUN, FUN game takes. It's a GREAT cd.rom for any age. Have some fun for pete's sake! This world is SO NEGATIVE! I Highly Recommend Barbie Sparkling Ice Show!!!"
"2","A good game to buy.","I bought this game for my daughter who is almost seven. She enjoys it very much. It works perfectly with Windows XP. I like the fact that it has skill levels, which helps avoid the ""frustration factor"", which I'm sure most of you reading this have experienced. The only reason that I did not give it a ""5"" is because it is quick to complete, especially on the ""easy"" and ""medium"" levels. Unless your child is totally into figure skating or Barbie, I feel this game is not for the 8+ crowd."
"2","Great Game","My daughter, almost 7, loves this game. She got it a few weeks ago and still plays with it every day. We did have to upgrade our system, but the game hasn't crashed since and hasn't been slow. Despite what others have said this game has lots of levels and takes lots of practice to master the freestyle levels. (The skaters will do lots of different tricks once the user learns how to do them.) This game has even seemed to help my daughter's actual skating - she just went yesterday for the first time since receiving the game and had lots more confidence and moved more smoothly than she did the other times she went."
"1","Not really what I wanted","For anybody who's looking for the 1978 movie with Lauren Bacall - this is not it ! Actually it's a 12 minute CBS music video by a group called ""Perfect Gentleman"" with 2 titles on it: ""Ooh la la"" and ""One more Chance"". This is not a rating of this video (I didn't bother watching it) but just of the fact that there's absolutely no information in the Amazon product details which could have told me this wasn't the feature film I was looking for before I ordered it. That's even more a pity as it was the fastest delivery I ever got from the US to Europe by Mail - a very short-lived joy."
"2","Rare find","A good book for Audi owners, and fans in general.The book dosen't just focus on the quattro itself, but the surrounding models as well.Not too much of a technical book, but more of an enthusiasts read."
"1","Fire Truck Puzzle","The fire truck puzzle arrived in the time that was stated. It is very colorful and well worth the price. The puzzle is a Christmas gift for a 2 year old, so at this time I can't state how he liked it. But I am very pleased with the quality."
"2","Dark Horses a must have CD","I have had this album on my 'must buy' cd list for some time and I finally got around to making the purchase in 2004. All I can say is that I should have purchased it earlier.A wash of alternative-rock-country-blues etched with dark and somber imagery. However it's not melancholic, just quietly introspective and laid-back.Works very well with a cup of coffee/tea, a newspaper and a lazy Sunday afternoon."
"1","Don't buy from Eforcity -- slow, disingenuous","What am I reviewing here... this gizmo or the supplier, Eforcity? I never received this product after my order! After waiting and waiting I contacted Eforcity several times -- no reply. After a nasty letter from me Eforcity'r reply feigned lacking information about my mailing address!What a cop-out.I told them I would not pay for it, so Eforcity said they'd give me a refund, which has not come to me yet. I bought another product to replace this from Amazon which arrived quickly from Amazon."
"1","Don't waste your money","I ordered this because my apartment doesn't have a light switch in the living room. It worked fine for about a week, then occassionaly would take 3 or 4 clicks to get the light to turn out. Now it will work 1 out of maybe 100 attempts, and only within 6 feet of the outlet. Terrible"
"1","Does not work!","It worked about 40% of the time when I was standing less than two feet from the outlet. When I moved eight to ten feet away it worked about 5% of the. I would not recommend it."
"2","Plug it in and it works!","Pull the battery saver tab, plug the unit into the wall and plug-in the device you want to control and everything works! I tried it from 25 feet away and through one wall and the remote turned my device on and off without a hitch!"

"2","The most charming, captivating work from LJ Smith!","The plot and characters are incredible. Everyone that likes the supernatural should read this book, and all the other Night World books. I think I'm in love with Ash!"
"2","Beautiful Love Story","I usually hate teenage romance books, but this book is great. I love the transition the characters go through and the romance. This is my favorite Night World beacuase of its characters and sitiuations. She mixes charm, romance, and humor. This book feels like real, even though it is horror, which makes you wonder. My favorite line in the book is ""This is a paranormal disaster area!"""
"2","The Best Yet!!!","Daughters of Darkness is the best yet!! I happened to pick it up by mistake in the Library and I Got hooked right away! I must have read it 50 times!! I loved the way Ash Tried to protect her from Jermey but she saved herself. I really hope there's another book on those two!"
"2","The Best","I just re-read Daughters of Darkness for about the 100th time and I just enjoy it more every time I read it. It has everything that you could want and more. Just one questionAre Mary-Lynnette and Ash ever going to find happiness together or will they be forced to spend their lives apart, longing for the one person who can make their life complete?To find out keep reading!!"
"2","Soul-mates","I have read nearly all of the books in the Night-world series, and I have to say that this one is my favourite, without a doubt! It is Ash of course that just makes this book, he is irrestible, I became hooked on him from the very first, I guess it's the whole 'bad-boy' vampyre thing he's got going on that you become addicted to him! I started reading these books years ago, but they went out of print, I would love to get the last few if anyone has any idea how I can get them! I would recommend these books to anyone of any age, I mean I'm 21 now, and I still love them!"
"2","Possibly the Best out of this series!","It was this book nearly 10 years ago that made me fall in love with L.J. Smith and her writing. I have read nearly everything by her in the years after my first encounter with Daughters of Darkness, yet this book remains dear to my heart. The characters pop out of the pages and you fall in love instantly with Rowan, Jade, and Kestrel...but you will especially fall in love with Ash. Look for Ash again in the 6th book of the series when he makes another appearance. This book is fantastic!"
"2","Amazing!","LJ smith is a fantastic author who inspires others to create stories and poetry that shows their true brilliance. Daughters of Darkness has a special quality about it which induces feeling of love and adventure all at the same time. I would not be surprised if people respond well to this novel!"
"2","One of the best books I've ever read!","DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS was the first book by L. J. Smith that Iread and I was hooked after that! I loved the way L. J. Smithdescribed all the characters, especialy Ash, and gave them all completely different personalities. This is, by far, one of the best books I've ever read and I can't wait for STRANGE FATE to come out. For anyone who is looking for another good series by L. J. Smith I suggest the Vampire Diaries and Dark Visions trilogies."
"2","Daughters of Darkness-THE BEST","I've read all of L.J Smiths books up until TheHuntress,which of course isn't out yet,and Ihave to say, that Daughters of Darkness wasprobably the best Night World so far. I'mobsessed with Ash,and Mary-Lynette was just awesomeANYBODY AND EVERYBODY MUST READ THIS BOOK"
"2","One of her best in the Night World series!","Out of all L.J.Smiths works this is one of my most highly recommended. If you have read any other books in the Night World series you will have recognized Ash(one of the main characters), who seems to pop up in many scenes. The heroine Mary Lynette is also one of my favorite characters. During the entire novel she dosn't appear as shaken as most would after learning of the Night World,finding her soulmate vampire and befriending 3 rogue vampires. Even if this series is unrealistic what better kind of book to lose yourself in. I find the whole concept of the Night World,wild powers and soulmates fascinating,this book is worth it."
"2","2 Humans and 3 vampires after a vampire slayer","I just loved Daughters of Darkness!! I must of read it about 50 times, really! It's such a good story line you just have to read it tunes of times! But it didn't really explain how Jeramey got there. How would he how where they were going?"
"2","I'm hooked and I want some more ...","I've only read up to Soulmate of the Night World series, but sofar Ihappen to be in agreement with almost all the other reviewers: Ash is my favourite male character!!! Did anyone notice that (so far) only Ash and Mary-Lynnette tried to fight their attraction? But why was it called ""Daughters of Darkness"" when Rowan, Kestrel and Jade weren't actually the main characters?P.S. I think L. J. Smith should let more characters become vampires. And how come all the main-character vampires are all male and the witches female???"
"2","L.J. Smith has so many correct details....","I'm writng again to say that this book has so many correct details, and the other books in this series are correct too. For instance, Speelbound has it right calling the Salem witch hunts the Burning Times. real witches do to. Isis is a a major person in witchcraft, and Hecate was the first witch. L.j Smith might as well be a wtich or vampire or whatever else for all the right details she has"
"2","It was great!!!","I like it. It was very cool to read about vampires and other legendary cratures of the night."
"1","Disappointing","I bought this book because I am a nonogram (also called Paint By Number) addict, and can't get enough of this type of puzzle. My disappointment is not so much with the quality of the puzzles within it but with the quality of the publishing. The paper is poor quality; it won't hold up under much erasing if you use pencil, and if you use gel pens, the ink bleeds through to the other side. The squares to color in are too large, making the finished image very pixillated and hard to make out. Also, the guide numbers are located at the right and bottom edges of the puzzle, instead of left and top, making it more difficult for a right-handed person to see while solving.Save your money, and buy the Games Magazine publication instead."
"2","mirroring the reader","I find it fascinating that this wonderful glimpse into our nation shortly before the American Revolution could be thought of as stuffy, boring and a waste of time. Hofstader, a brilliant and yet very human scholar, has offered us a wonderfully concise, compelling and illuminating read - a rare and precious gift to anyone wishing to examine the evolution of our nation. He has done all the work, not only allowing us to form our own conclusions from the facts rather than spoon-feeding us his unsubstantiated opinion, but has presented this vast amount of data in a breezy, very readable manner. The only explanation I could arrive at of how anyone could find this great book a waste of time is that these reviews are as much a reflection of the reviewer as the book under review.Bravo Professor Hofstader. I regret that you did not live to complete your masterpiece."
"1","Don't Waste Yout Time","Unless you are under obligation to read this for some sort of class, I would not recomend wasting yout time trying to wade through the quagmire of redundantly long, boring text. If I could pay attention to it for more than two sentences at a time, most likely I would find it to have a wealth of information; but it's dry, overly-intellecual style makes it impossible to stay interested. If you're looking for a challenge to read, you face two; deciphering the nealry 300 pages of rediculously long sentences, and staying awake. I even go so far as to say reading it is a complete waste of time, because the energy you must invest to understand this work' coupled witht the frustration of an endlessly boring stlye does not even compared to the information you will actually get out of it."
"1","Thick, dry and packed full of somewhat useful information","To read this book you need to be fully awake and have full concentration. This is not the type of book to bring to the beach. Though Richard Hofstadter makes a convincing case of what colonial times were like and he obviously was a scholar, he writes very monotonously. if not thouroughly interested in american history at 1750 i would not recommend this book. otherwise, if you are a history-fanatic, this book gives a wide range of perspectives and fully covers the history of the time."
"2","Kylie takes a bite at subtlety....","Kylie Minogue isn't a very subtle performer - she's famous for hi-NRG floorfillers, not purring ballads. A ballad in the hands of a pop singer can be a nightmare but with Kylie, it's a dream and CHOCOLATE is a perfect example of it. Sweet and slow, it flows like its namesake throughout, with a catchy chorus that will for sure melt her fans down. Remixed for release, this CD also includes the funky CITY GAMES, two remixes (the EMO mix is the better one) and a live track, taken from her BODY LANGUAGE LIVE DVD, which should receive a late 2004 release in the USA."
"2","A rare & wondeful treat","I was extremely lucky to have found this, because it is a) an import & b) limited edition...especially lucky to find just thrown in the kylie section of a Pennsylvania Borders! Ok, here it is track-by-track:1. Chocolate [Radio Edit]:While this cuts the album version of the song by one minute and two seconds, it's better. Her vocals are improved, & more of an arrangement is used. 10/102. City Games: THis extreme rarity is fabulous. Very R&B; pop. 10/103. Chocolate [Tom Middleton Cosmos Remix]: A club dub. Cool when you have so much energy in you that you have to dance it out, but not for a regular listen. 7/104. Chocolate [EMO Mix]: Woderful. A good R&B; dance mix of the song. 9/105. Love @ First Sight [Live]: A live version of the Fever hit. I usually love live sounds, but this when isn't quite up to par with the original. 8/10I still have yet to figure out how to access the video. (...)Overall great package, great mixes, great rarities."
"2","nifty","It is very convenient to have the charging cable available without having the cord all over the place in the way. Works well too."
"2","Grandson enjoyed maybe 20 times!","Fine. Boys and the toys or trains I forget how many times kids can watch a movie and then watch it again"
"1","Very annoying!","This video is really a disappointment, it came with a Thomas piece so naturally my daughter picked it and I thought the bonus ""feature"" wouldn't be mixed in with the actually Thomas stories but I was wrong. My daughter easily lost interest when the people would come on and talk about loving Thomas and getting to ride the real Thomas train... I was totally annoyed."
"1","Extremely Disappointed with this video","I never write reviews but I just felt compelled after I saw this video. It's 70% listening to parents and kids think about Thomas and maybe 30% Thomas related. What is worse is that you have to fast forward through a bunch of the rambling in order to see what amounts to a 5 minute story. And, there is only one song in the ""Sing A Long"". I really liked Thomas stories after watching them on PBS with my daughter. Next time, I will try to find those stories on video. They actually last about 15 minutes and do not involve mindless prattle from people I don't know."
"1","Just so-so","This is a DVD with footage of a ""Come Out and Meet Thomas"" day mixed in between the episodes. Sort fo a promotional piece to be honest. Still decent enough to rent. The DVD extras are limited and not very good. My son seems to like it o kay but it gets pushed aside for more interactive stuff to be found on Sodor Celebration. There is also a ton of toys shown during the ""party/interview"" footage which can be a good or bad thing depending on how much you need to control that sort of thing with your child. Also I for one get annoyed at the interviewes not sure why they just annoy me. This production has the feel of an old VHS video copied to DVD without much added to it. I wouldn't throw it out but I wouldn't buy it either."
"1","More than Thomas, Not Geared Toward Children As Much","I bought this thinking it would be packed with Thomas stories. Turns out there are only ten, which is a typical Thomas DVD. However, between each story, it also has interviews with parents and their kids about what they like about Thomas. As I parent, I'm not interested in this, and I know that my 3 year old would rather watch Thomas than a bunch of strangers any day. Plus, the sing-along section has one song. One. We have other Thomas videos that has at least 4, and they aren't special DVD's, just normal Thomas collections. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, if you are looking for solely Thomas stories and can find other collections."
"1","A long promo for the Thomas center(s)","Unless I missed something, there are only one or two actual episodes on this DVD. The rest is a long commercial for the Thomas the Train centers and an ode to Ms. Allcroft. Waste of money."
"1","Poor DVD","Has too many interviews with people at the Live THomas day in Penn. My kids were annoyed and hated this DVD."
"1","My Son finds it annoying","My 2 year old son is huge Thomas fan. This DVD has long introductions to each story in which children and adults are interviewed - my son couldn't care less. He just wants to see trains! We have a portable DVD player, and it is a big pain to try to fast forward past these introductions, and he (and I) just ends up frustrated. My advice - pick another DVD."
"1","Feels like a commercial...","All the interspersed kid and parent interviews where they talk about all the trains they have just feels like a thinly disguised effort to sell more product.It's also AWFULLY frustrating that you can't jut buy the DVD Series here as you can in the UK, but have to make do with compilations where there are invariably episode duplications.*sigh*"
"2","Makes you not want to sleep at night.....","This is about a kid who, when asleep, unleashes something horrific. part two of the night warriors, it is a brilliantly done novell and i recommend this to anyone who is a gore fanatic and masterton lover!!"
"1","$25K warranty isn't included in packaging or at APC site","This product description is WRONG. I purchased this product because of this ""$25,000"" equipment warranty. Product received only states that the actual surge protector is under warranty and has no mention of equipment warranty. Is Amazon starting to make stuff up now?"
"2","Great little surge protector","Great value for a surge protector. I've got 'em on lots of electronics (printers, phones, laptops) that don't need a full power strip or universal power supply (UPS). Very portable for laptops, in case you're travelling."
"1","Too Small","I have bought dockers for years but these are cut smaller than they usually are. Even with the ""stretch"" waist band they are tight. So much for an ""extra"" inch. Beware. Try these in a store before you buy."
"2","A good product available in convenient range of sizes","This product earns five stars not just because it is comfortable to wear and looks good but because it is available in more size (inseam) ranges than other Dockers products. And by ordering online one can largely avoid the disappointment of store stock outs."
"1","TOM ATKINSON REVIEW","I DID NOT GET THE SLACK THAT HAD THE WAISTBAND. I GOT SLACK WITH NO WAISTBAND, SO I SEND THEM BACK AN WAS TRYING TO GE A 42 29 BUT I RECEIVED A E MAIL STATETING THAT THE PRODUCT WAS NO LONGER AVABILITY. SO FAR I'AM NOT SURE WERE MY REFUND WENT. PLEASE LET ME KNOW.TOM ATKINSON"
"1","Cut smaller than usual","I agree, these are cut small... Buy an inch or two larger than you normally do. The waist band does NOT stretch."
"1","Wrong item sent.","I got the shippment quickly. But wrong items was sent. I have to return it to the seller. I got the refund pretty quick, but only for the value of product. I spent about &10 for two way shipping without geting anything."
"1","Too bad....","Did not like the pants at all, and threw them in the trash rather than pay return postage. Flimsy, smelled of dye, cheap fabric, etc. Too bad."
"2","Dockers do the job.","This product was just what I was hoping for, and I had no problem with shipping. I highly recommend this product."
"1","False advertising","If you search for Super Saver shipping this advertisement comes up, but this product is not shipped by Amazon is does not go out with the Super Saver shipping, and the cost of shipping is nearly 20% the cost of the pants."
"1","Don't Trust the Images","Dockers are Dockers, so that's not the problem. Just be sure you don't trust the images if you choose to buy these via Amazon. ""Cafe,"" for example, should be ""Coffee."" Despite the fact that the image for ""Cafe"" shows a stone or very light gray color, ""Cafe"" is actually dark brown. So the product isn't defective, but IS misleading: I didn't want brown pants, but that's what I got."
"1","So disappointed","I have worn these pants for years; my size is the same as always. I couldn't get them on; they were so tight I couldn't get the button buttoned around the waist. What is going on? These pants seemed to be cut for a skinny 25 year old, not someone who is a little on the hefty side. Further, the shipping and handling charges are just out of sight...$16.95 above and beyond the already rather pricy product. I would not recommend doing business with this seller at all. You can go to other outlets and get the same thing without the shipping and handling, and there are ""deals"" out there from major store chains. I was really disappointed in this product and the seller. Go to WalMart and get their khakis; they are very inexpensive and wear like iron."
"2","Fantastic Book","This book is a modern retelling of Sleeping Beauty with an emphasis on the power of family to help a boy through a terrible time. It is best suited for a mature, inquisitive child. War is a reality that parents should not shy away from talking about to their children."
"1","Disturbing","Although the images are very well rendered, they arefrightening. I am baffled about the impression this book is supposedto leave on children. This book may be picked up on the thought that it is a retold fairy tale, when it is an abstract and grim retelling of the horrors of WWII in Berlin. The most horrifying image is that of Major Kreig's big black gloves enveloping the body of the little boy. This book is NOT appropriate for younger readers. I can see how this book might be valuable for an alternative look at the war for middle schoolers or higher."
"2","A Taste of Italy","Longing for vicarious travel? Imagining your college days, interrupted by an Italian adventure ... which turns into one of the romantic kind? And full of the silly things that come with youth, attraction and confusion? I just wanted to add my two-cents on this item, which I found, despite brief lapses in credibility, and hoppingly gullible moments, sufficiently engaging to remind me of my love of Rome. And now I have an even greater appreciation for the breadth and depth of Italian culture and character, and the wonders of eating their special dishes. Fun and satisfying."
"2","Perfect book for a long flight....",".... or a lazy afternoon. This book is like watching a romantic movie. It is interesting, feel good and 'tasty'. Capella has done a good job of holding the reader's interest with fun descriptions of food, chefs, Rome, locals and the Italian countryside.I happened to pick this book up at a used book store and I am glad I did. You'll like this book if you are a romantic/ a foodie/ love to travel/ love Italy and Italian food or all of the above."
"2","Delicious reading","I found the book to be light-hearted, fun and relatively fast-moving. True, it was predictable, but that didn't detract from Capella's take on the triad of Bruno, Laura and Tomasso. In fact, it was nice to see how Cappella put his spin on the Cyrano story. The descriptions of the food and the locale enhanced the story and added to the atmosphere, though at times were a ""trifle overdone"" (pun intended). The only thing that kept me from giving this a 5 was the author's descriptions of the sex scenes which were at times too graphic -- too male, perhaps, like reading Playboy/Penthouse letters -- for my taste. In all, though, the book was entertaining and a fun way to occupy a few summer afternoons."
"2","Wonderfully romantic book that sweeps you to Italy","THE FOOD OF LOVE is absolutely amazing. From page one I felt like I was in Italy, smelling the smells, seeing the sights and above all, tasting the food.This book is for those who love life in all its sensual glory, who believe in recognizing your soul mate at first sight and who think that fairy tales can come true. I devoured the book (pun intended) from start to finish. It made me appreciate food and its preparation, and we're booking a trip to Italy as soon as possible to discover some of the dishes described.What Water for Chocolate did for Mexican food, this does for Italian. There is magic in preparing food for those you love. This is a fable, a romance (in the medieval sense of the word). It's about the magic and wonder of food and love, the sensual beauty of the world."
"2","I just wanted to cook for my husband on those dark and stary nights...","This book is better than ANY of the great trashy historical romances I have EVER read. I love to cook; I love to eat; I love my husband. This book made a great week for all three. It was an inspiration for me to perfect a couple of things, cooking and uhmmmm. If you want to get INSPIRED too, then read this book!! I'd pair it with a couple of cooking books, like Cooking in the Nude: the one for newlyweds, Booty Food, Inter-courses, or something like that. Enjoy a great book!"
"2","One of the best!","If you are looking for something that entertains, tells a great story, and inspires you to want to go to Italy and fall in love with someone (or with the food) this is the perfect book. I recommend it as mandatory reading for all groups I bring to Italy. All who have read it, especially women, love it."
"2","Cameriere!","I enjoyed this book-- it was much better than the standard ""chick lit"" titles. It was a lightweight story, easy to read, and the Roman food, cooking, markets and people were fun. Didn't mind the creative cursing-- how very true to ""Roman young stud"" it was! Maybe the Laura character was a bit underdeveloped, but I much prefered to read about Bruno.I liked this book SO MUCH more than ""Cooking for Mr. Latte"" - it was a fun read."
"2","Food porn, and I mean that in the best possible way","I didn't like the ending, the characterization leave something to be desired, and the writing didn't make me think, but, oh I didn't notice any of that (Well, except for the ending) at the time, or even until substatially after it was all over. During, I read and read, bathing in the glorious food descriptions, not to mention the allure of Italy. Oh Yes!"
"2","""Chick Lit "" for ""Foodies""","What a great read = tips on cooking,lovemaking and Italian insults. Laughed and laughed. Thanks. Looking forward to film."
"1","Not very good....","I bought this book to read as I myself ventured the streets of Italy...and to my dismay, the book was horrible. I searched everywhere for the book here in the states, and it was sold out everywhere...and to be honest, I am not sure why! All of the characters were not very well depicted, except for Laura. The description of Rome and the other cities the book took place in where not vivid. And the plot very predictible. The addition of the mafia in the story could have also been completely taken out...there was no need for it in the book! I just can't seem to think of anything really good to say about this book...maybe the recepies at the end are good to cook?"
"1","Do not waste your time....lousy","This is one of the worst written books I have ever read.I wish I had saved my money and my time.The book is full of superlatives. Everything is ""the best ever experienced"" again and again.The characters NEVER become embraceable. One male character is pathetic while the other is a jerk. The female lead is portrayed as perhaps innocently unaware, but is really just stupid. Her friend is promiscuous, which is all we ever really get to know of her.The writing is at a level well below that of an adult reader. But, the content could not possibly be meant for a younger reader. Very inappropriate.Not sure who would really like this book.Maybe someone who really likes descriptions of food and does not care about plot, story development, characterization or any other facets of literature.Find yourself something with a little more substance, and I think you'll be much happier."
"1","The food is sexier than the sex","This book as all about the joy of eating and cooking and love.It's a lot better when it deals with food than with love. In fact, food is not only a metaphor for love and love-making but seems a more than adequate substitute. People have virtual orgasms cooking and eating but the sex is pallid and occasionally positively unappetizing.I can see why this book has been successful but to appreciate it one has to overlook the thin characters and absurd plot, openly cribbed from Cyrano de Bergerac. The most enjoyable parts are the opening chapters. After that, the returns swiftly diminish.Still, for a plane ride, one could do worse I suppose."
"1","Back to basics","Generally speaking a great book if you are not familiar with management accounting and turning heaps of information into valuable reports for your top management group. No doubt about it: This book will provide the basic tools for keeping your boss happy, especially if you need a brush-up on moving averages, etc. Having vast experience with both advanced financial and non-financial analysis on various aspects of business (shipping and construction), this book was somewhat a let down in terms of ability to inspire and provide ways to improve personal skills to structure and present complex topics in an ordered and clear fashion. A nice bedtable-reader for the pre-MBA. MBAs should look elsewhere."
"1","CASH MONEY AND NO LIMIT ARE THA SAME THANG!","THERE BEATS ARE DIFFERENT THAN NO LIMITS BUT THERE FROM THA SAME PLACE AND THERE GHETTO HOOD IS VERY CLOSE.THEY RAP JUST LIKE NO LIMIT.BUT NO LIMIT WAS FIRST AND IT WILL BE THA LAST.NO LIMIT IS STILL NUMBER1 IN EVERY WAY."
"1","Just as trashy as garbage music comes...","I listen to every kind of music in existence, and I always give everything a chance. But now I'm permanently going to start ignoring every CD with a CASH MONEY record label on it. They're CASH MONEY Millionaires, and why? Because they fill a CD with a bunch of horrible songs and repetitive beats. They're millionaires because they repeat the words ""huh,"" ""what,"" and ""yeah"" for every 3 or 4 minute song they make. They're millionaires because people who expect this kind of music to be the next BIG thing make them millionaires. Bottom line: HotBoys are garbage, and so is every other artist signed onto the Cash Money label. I will NEVER consider this good music, and I hope that this is just a passing fad because if this is what ""so-called"" hip-hop music is coming to...then I only hope it's worth your money cause I ain't gonna spend a penny on it."
"1","this album is garbage,straight bfi material","cash money records is going to have to up with something a lil better than this if they plan on making it in this game.the beats where alright but the rappers a terrible.none of the have a goog flow to accomidate the beats.try again cmr.maybe next time."
"2","I feel ya ""Ghenry187@aol""...this CD rocks. No Limit can't...","I feel ya ""Ghenry187@aol.com""...this CD rocks. No Limit can't touch Cash $ Money Records. I don't know why that new Tru CD sold one million in the first place. Who cares, 'cause I just checked the billboard charts and discovered that Juvenile sold more that two million. So they can't be faded. Anyway, back to this CD. Every song on this CD rocks. My favorite song is ""Help"" by B.G. I love this CD."
"1","save your $$$","I can't believe how much this cd sucks, save yourself 17 bucks & just download the ""we on fire"" mp3 its the only decent track on the album. And if u r looking for more ""bounce"" party tracks like ""back that ass up"" too bad; u won't find any here. What a rip."
"1","PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS CD!","I was truly disappointed in this album. The beats are all overused and unoriginal. The only thing that makes this album is Young Turk. He has the hottest rap out of all the Hot Boys. If you haven't heard his freestyle, you don't know what's up. Turk is off da chains. I can't wait for his solo album to drop. Ya'll need to recognize, quit hatin' Turk."
"2","Worst music ever....but I love it.","I don't know if you can actually call this music. It is truly terrible. However, I love listening to it for some strange music. ... I am not normally a fan of rap music, but I laugh out loud every time I hear some of these songs. These Cash Money guys should be comedians. Except for Juvenile, since I can't understand anything he says, which is also rather funny. Don't buy it for the music, but it for the comedy."
"2","classic","most underrated rap group, when lil wayne actually talked real s*** besides aliens and skateboards..if u like lil Wayne u should deffinetly love this album"
"2","NO, NOT 5 STARZ 6 STARZ!","this album hea is just ""too hot"". this album is tha first album that really made me like all the songs. cash money is my favorite rap label and i like other labels too but it don't get no realer than this right cha'. this album is just to real, i mean, every song on it just blow up. every single day when i come home from school, i just have to stop and take some time out and listen to Hot Boys ""Guerilla Warfare"". like i said in the beginning ""not 5 starz 6 starz"", if you know what i mean!"
"1","THIS IS A ONE COMPARED TO JUVENILEZ 400 DEGREEZ","ALL I WILL SAY IS THIS WAS A GREAT RELEASE WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT A FOUR, BUT AFTER HAVING HEARD JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ TODAY (SEPT. 30, 1999) FOR THE FIRST TIME (NOTE: YES, I KNOW I'M LATE LISTENING TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ) I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MANIE FRESH AND JUVENILE. JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ IS THE BEST CD SINCE SNOOPS'S DOGGYSTYLE AND DRE'S CHRONIC. BUT THIS CD IS NOTHING COMPARED TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ! IF YOU DON'T HAVE 400 DEGREEZ, GO BUY THAT ONE INSTEAD OF THIS!"
"1","The worst rap I ever Heard","This is what is in the dictionary under wack. I can't belive that this many people bought this (...) The hot boys are just a fad like bellbottoms. (...) If you think this is what rap is about u just plain stupid and I'm glad this hot boy stuff is almost over wit. When some of my friends play this crap in the car I just rather get out and walk."
"2","super hot","lil wayne and turk set the whole cd off the untamed killer seem to know how to flow. his beats are for real and i cant wait for lil wayne to come out with his solo cd"
"1","super wack","just like No-Limit Cash Money has no shame at putting out garbage music.wack beats and no lyric ryhmes.who is buying this crab? all the stuff sounds the same and it's not that average.it's all bad."
"1","ghetto foolishness","i like the Hot Boys and really like Juvenile, but this is not good. the only thing good is ""we on fire"" and ""I need a hot girl"". just download those 2 songs onto your Ipod and skip this album."
"1","Please try another Hot Boy album...","Guerriula Warfare is an album I fell is something, and that something is everything. The lyrics are most of the time meanless and pointless. Also the beat and backround music of the songs sometimes don't even fit could for the lyrics or how the rapper is rapping. Overall please go out and get another Hotboy album or something. Or just another album in the lines of Cash Money, just please not this one..."
"2","Fun To Listen To.","This is the second best Cash Money album I've ever heard next to Juvenile's 400 Degreez which is definetely a 5 Star cd too. The Hot Boys put out an album with like 5 or 6 really strong songs. And as bunch of other average or a little better songs. Not really any horrible songs at all. The Best Songs are the main 4 ""I Need A Hot Girl"", ""We On Fire"", ""Respect My Mind"" & ""Tuesday & Thursday"". Those 4 songs were the songs I listened to every morning for like months and months. And i have over 200 cd's! So this cd must be good huh? ""Ridin'"" is another real tight one! Then the other songs all blend in with the rest like ""Clear Tha Set"" by Lil'Wayne. ""Ya Dig"" by Juvenile. ""Help"" by B.G., and ""Bout Whatever"" by Turk. I Think it's cool that all of them got there own solo songs. ""Too Hot"" is nice too..along with the rest of the songs. Juvenile, B.G., Turk & Lil'Wayne put out one of the best cd's of '99, and also the best group cd to come out for a long while!It's real good!"
"2","Did you like 400 degreez?","A continuation of the illest hip-hop album in recent times, 400 degreez. If you aren't down w/ C.M.B yet, go get 400 degreez first. If you already got and you love it, this is just another hour of banging bump and car music. Great"
"1","This CD iz Aight...........","FIRST OF ALL HOW COME ALL YA'LL BE DISSIN' NO LIMIT (for all ya'll that did not diss em' dis ain't for you) WHAT YA'LL TALKLIN ABOUT CASH MONEY CAN NEVER GET WITH NO LIMIT AND THAT IS A FACT.....

"2","Tha One","this c.d. is off the hook. it blew the sets up down here. everybody need to quit hatin cuz you don't know what's up hot boys can flow and they be tearin up the charts"
"2","Short book explaining Love and Logic","At first I was disappointed that this wasn't a longer book, but then I realized that it is great to give away to curious friends and parents as an introduction to Love and Logic. I just wish it was a little cheaper."
"2","Book review","This is a book for all parents or parents to be, all people thinking of having children. Love and Logic is a program to help you be a more effect parent, raising responsible children. It can also be used on co workers and the rest."
"2","A Novel as Enjoyable as the Restaurant Antoine's","If you've ever eaten at the wonderful restaurant Antoine's in the French Quarter of New Orleans (with its many themed Mardi Gras private rooms), you will definitely enjoy this book. And even if you haven't eaten at Antoine's, if you're interested in New Orleans society mid-way through the 20th Century, you'll find this a delightful mystery.In addition, the home of the late author, Frances Parkinson Keyes, is open to the public in New Orleans. It's actually called the Beauregard Keyes House after Confederate General Beauregard who stayed there and Frances Parkinson Keyes. And the author also wrote a novel about the house called ""Madame Castel's Lodger,"" which is filled with the interesting history of General Beauregard.-- Phyllis Zimbler Miller"
"2","An old friend","This beautifully written novel in a gently used library copy now joins my little shelf of Unlimited Re-Reads reserved for just such special old friends as The Virginian, Until the Sun Falls, O the Brave Music, A Dance to the Music of Tim, Persuasion and The Final Reflection. The words are worn smooth by familiarity and give the pleasure of fingering a stash of precious stones. Dinner at Antoine's is also touching as a memory of New Orleans in a former time among the privileged classes, with a sunny certainty that nothing will ever change (it is set in January-February 1948)."
"1","NOT A RIDE ON","I should have paid closer attention to the size of this horse when I ordered it, but it should not be in the ride-on section. It is clearly not a ride on toy. It is tiny. The beanie babies ride on this horse and fit perfect. All it is is a stuffed horse on wheels and it is so tiny. My kids never play with it. This was a learning lesson for me with shopping online."
"2","Excellent - Very Useful","I find this book highly useful as a desktop reference for just about anything HTML/DHTML related. In addition, Powell does a great job of introducing topics that may be new to some people, like XML."
"2","Wonderful. A thorough reference guide.","I needed a comprehensive, intelligent guide covering HTML, DHTML, CSS etc. This book provides that and more in a easy to understand manner, that isn't too simplistic for an advanced web author. A smart layout, and nice index helps you locate what you need fast. Color charts, CSS style references, tag attributes a-plenty, DHTML overviews and in-depth information is there when you need it. If you're looking to spend on a clever guide to take you into the ever expanding world of web technologies, this book is a excellent resource!"
"2","Fantastic Advanced Course!","Many parts of this book are difficult to understand for the beginning and intermediate user. It is an informative, advanced reference; the only one needed for an experienced website creator. There are no color examples of what the HTML language produces, making some of it difficult to piece together if you are not experienced."
"2","Simply excellent !!! No Comparision","I am a system analyst with IBM background, client server is totally new for me and being a novice in this area I found this book of immense help. The topics have been beautifully explained. HTML, XML, CSS,DHTML are no longer nightmares for me. I must say that from day one itself I started writing HTMLs. This book is simply great for anybody who would like to learn about HTML. I would recommend this books to beginners as well as experts for reference. The book is worth buying. This is worth 5+ star rating."
"1","Complete reference... yes","Well although i found the book to be extremely informative and I learned a great deal from it, I was very disapointed that I could not get a lot of the examples to work for me. I am not talking about the images but the actual pages did not come up the way the way the book depicts them if you type them in exactly the way it is printed. I had to tweek them a bit to make them work correctly. I fell that I am going to have to go elsewhere to find the right type of book for me. Other than that the book did have a lot of information to give and will keep it as a reference as the book's title plainly details."
"2","Good place to start Web development","It is a great book for all new arrivals to the Web development and design world. The book's title doesn't indicate the real content, it is not just HTML, it is an introduction to web design covering HTML, JavaScript, Client-Programming, Server-Programming, CSS, XML, and many other topics. I recommend it to all beginners but wishing to become experts."
"2","Keeps me healthy and I am not allergic to this brand.","I like the Solaray Brand. I am not allergic to it. Vitamin D-3 was recommended by my doctor. The Vitamin D-3 keeps me healthy."
"2","Thoughtful, contemporary fiction","Excellent novel about cultural/generational borderlands and the search for personal identity. Tells the story of three marginalised young outcasts who forge a strong bond of friendhip that helps see them through various life dramas. Teo is a highly intelligent writer who makes you care about her characters, she is also excellent at evoking the flavour of various cultures in her writing. A thought provoking tale of borders, boundaries and coming of age in the cultural melting pot of contemporary Australia, told with plenty of wit and heart."
"2","Why Some People Complain","The thing that most people don't understand about the FFVI sound track is that it couldn't possibly sound the same as the game. When people buy it they are expecting the exact same music and they heard while playing it, but it just wouldn't be done. On the original SNES system that this game was made for it had a very poor sound quality system in it. It was only about 16 bits if even that much. Nobody would want to listen to the poor quality music that the game produced when they could hear it orchestrated and remastered like the future FF Series games had. All in all i thought that this sound track was an excellent portrayal of the way the music should have sounded, had the game been placed on a CD based system instead of a 16 bit SNES cartridge system."
"1","My Daughter Hates It","I got this throat spray in a hurry hoping to relieve my 3.5 yo daughter from a bad sore throat. It tastes awful, and it's just not meant for a young child. I got it after a recommendation from another mom, and it was a bad decision. I'll keep it to numb a scratched-up knee or elbow."
"2","glider","the glider got here much sooner than I thought, it arrived in great shape and all the pieces were there. I put it together by myself even if the kept saying 2 people. It was not hard and directions were simple.. It's really nice"
"1","bench","The bench is very nice. I had a few pieces that looked like they were painted over scratches and some of the metal were scratched. I was unsure of some of the screws as you can not tighten it too much or is strips the plastic. wasnt sure on the indents on the metal bars which way they were suppose to go on. the bench broke after sitting on it three times. The glider bar broke. the weld is not very good or sturdy."
"2","Great Glider","We needed to replace a wooden glider that we had in front of our house and after looking around and not really finding what we were looking for our son suggested we check Amazon.com. We chose this one because we felt it would last for a long time and the size was right. When we received it we put it together and it was very easy to assemble. The movement of the glider is smooth. The color is a little blah, but we added a couple of colorful pillows and have received many compliments on it. The price is great and we are very happy with our purchase!"
"1","Gauges in chair arms","Chair is the product ordered, however it came with gauges in the arms. The chair was well packed and the damage appeared to have happened at the factory before wrapping for shipment. Poor quality control. Not worth returning the product. Other than that, the bench is substantial and as promised. I have pictures taken while I was unwrapping, but couldn't figure out how to include them."
"2","Very nice glider","Good quality and fairly easy to assemble, although it helps to have 2 people. It is quite comfortable and looks nice."
"2","Fantastic glider/ bench","Right after I clicked the purchase button for this, I remember wondering what the heck I was doing buying a glider bench off the internet. It was so reasonably priced compared to the ones I had checked out in stores, I figured I was getting some flimsy, poorly made item. But this bench is awesome! My husband put it together in about 30 minutes by himself and it's sturdy but light enough that I can drag it around our backyard to catch the sun (or not). It has held up to all the wet weather we've had, it's easy to clean and glides beautifully. It really is a quality product - I'm thinking of buying a second one for our patio."
"2","James Moody takes San Diego ""Beyond the Border""!","James Moody, and his well known ""cast of characters"" have put together an awsome sample of what can be done when you think everything else has already been done... I really enjoy listening to this up and coming jazz artist because he has a style that is all his own. I play this CD everytime I am trying to impress someone...and it never fails to do the job. There are some really great songs in new styles that consistantly perk up my friends ears when they hear it. They know that song, but they've ""never heard it played like THAT before""."
"1","Seal IV","I am a huge fan of Seal's first 3 albums, so I rushed out to buy this one the minute it came out. What a disappointment!! Most of the songs sound like old remixes of Curtis Mayfield tunes. The only 2 with that eerie signature 'Seal' sound are 'heavenly' and 'tinsel town'. I'd say go to Itunes....listen to the songs...buy the tunes you like (if there are any) and call it a day."
"2","Woburn: Forgotten Tales & Untold Stories","I purchased this book hoping to find some history of the town that one of my ancestors Samuel Richardson, helped found. Although there was little mention of people from my direct line, this was an extremely interesting read of the history after the town was founded in 1630. The history and characters are real and the various chapter authors did an excellent job of researching facts and putting them into facinating stories. This book gave me a better understanding of what several generations went through in order to make Woburn what it is today. This would be a great read for anyone interested in the early history of the United States."
"1","Too Much on the Mystical Plate","The idea behind God was in this Place and I, i did not know it is excellent. Take the famous line from Jacob at Beth-el, and see how it has been interpreted throughout the ages by various Jewish worthies. In the process, have them talk to Jacob in a kind of free form midrash, unshackled by time. And since the writer is Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, add a bit a personal reflection and home grown stories.All the elements are here, but the book never gets off the ground. In juggling so many elements in so short a space, Kushner gets lost, and the book lacks a real sense of forward momentum or thrust. This would have been a good idea for two, maybe even three books. Kushner would have then allowed himself the luxury of exploring some of the very good themes he has laid down here and not fully explored."
"2","God's Zoo","Wonderful video, very comical and loved by kids, also teaches some good Biblical truths and good gospel songs."
"2","Different","The average work about socialism talks about such dry topics as economics and politics. This essay doesn't do any of that. It goes into art, and even pseudo-psychology (one could say). It covers a broad variety of topics in a short amount of pages. I agree with almost everything said in this book. It's definitely worth reading and will really make you think."
"2","Awesome","This is probably the best essay I have ever read. It has defined my political reviews still today. It's a work of true romanticism."
"2","An interesting little essay","Although the title is the soul of man under socialism, the theoretical basis for what he talks about would be more of a collective anarchy commune which fosters his individualism more than the socialisms that we have seen in theory and practice in the last couple of centuries.This is an interesting little essay because of its meandering nature. it starts out as a political tract, then veers into a brief on aesthetics and then tries to synthesize the two at the end. For me, its process felt unsuccessful, but at least there are many places that can be quotable.Quotable -- to the point that I wanted to, in a half-hearted daydream, to imagine using this text as a theoretical basis to look at Wilde's own creative work to see if he meets his own aesthetic standards. While that project may not be worthwhile, the reading of this essay is worthwhile."
"2","Great Actors - Well done film!","Shah Rukh Khan is my favorite actor. I enjoy seeing Rani Mukerji paired with him. This film was well done. It showed some of the difficulties couples might face after marriage. One thing that stood out to me, which bothered me, was that the ""in-laws"" of Rani's character seemed prejudiced against Shah Rukh Khan's character. I believe that once a family member has married someone, the rest of the family should be respectful and supportive of that choice and welcome and love the new spouse. Most romantic films focus on the relationship up until marriage, with the idea that the couple will live ""Happily Ever After"". However, the reality is that relationships need to be cared for after marriage. And this film gives a glimpse into the reality of marriage."
"2","Great movie, not so great DVD","This is one of my favorite bollywood movies. If you're a fan of Shahrukh Khan or Rani Mukerji you'll love this movie. It's interesting too in that it goes beyond the usual pretty love story. Where a lot of movies consist of ""boy meets girl, boy woos girl, boy and girl get married"" this movies looks at the question of ""then what?"" I know some people have complained about the bickering in the second half, but I didn't think it was that excessive. The movie just portrays the usual silly arguments and misunderstandings that couples face.I'd give the movie five stars but this particular product gets only 4 stars for the DVD quality. It's definitely pixilated in parts, not the best quality picture. Still watchable, and I wouldn't return it, but wish the picture was a bit better."
"1","an extreme emotional ride","If you want to watch a movie where a couple meets, falls in love, gets married, almost breaks up, have cat fights, get angry, make up, has new problems, lie to each other, hurt each other again, almost break up, really do break up, cry, yell at each other, cry again, then finally make up because there's not really anything else to do - then this is the movie for you.If you do, for some reason, decide to watch this, watch it to the point where they get married -THEN TURN IT OFF (being bollywood, thats about the length of a regular movie anyway)."
"1","Grrrrr. Arrrrgh.","We few, we lucky few, who must endure the Praxis II Practices of Learning & Teaching Test will find no guide here.There is a brief discussion of the structure of the test, and some sample questions, yes, but the content of the test is not discussed at all outside the sample question. I would have loved to see a literature or concept review, such as is found in almost every other test guide on the planet.Also, it seems the PRAXIS II went from a five-response to a four-response test at some point, and the authors responded by chopping answer E off all the sample questions, without checking whether or not that was the correct answer. In other words, they revised the questions, but did not revise the answers. Most frustrating.In all, I found this book a sorry excuse for a test guide, and recommend it for nothing except mulching, or perhaps kindling."
"2","I give it 5 stars because it's entombed","I have waited nearly four months for this album and the wait is finally over, it's a good little album, show casing the many talents of this great metal band. It's not left hand path or wolverine blues material (both albums are in a league of their own, respectively) but for a moment just try to forget about the past work of entombed and listen to this like u are listening to them for the first time, I know that it is hard though. I recommend for the metal maniacs, entombed's new album, ""uprising"". I have owned it for about 2 weeks and it gets better with each listen, one for the collection. Entombed are the greatest band in the whole world...Cheers!"
"1","bye bye mom and dad","My children and I love the little Critter books. This is a great book, but it was not bound well. The book fell out of the cover within a few days of recieving it."
"2","Bass - voice delight in jazz music","Miss Jordan always had a special attitude for the bass, the bass lines she uses to play with singing in a group. As much as Anita O'Day used to do whith drums, Sheila Jordan has the unique ability to express herself in a clear, witty and unique way, scatting or singin words, talking and exchanging suggestions with the acoustic bass player. This is the second, according to my knowledge, and probably one of the very best of her duo recordings. A must for jazz fans and listeners keen to jazz singers with an instrumental attitude."
"2","Danelectro DJ-20C Rocky Road Spin Speaker Mini Effects Pedal","This pedal is cheaply made but it sounds terrific, makes even a cheap organ sound half decent.It really does give you that Leslie effect if you mess around with the settings a little.It smells of burnt rubber as it is cheaply made but apart from that, I would highlyrecommend it for a keyboard but not much use for a guitar really. The price is good forwhat you get as with all Danelectro effect pedals. I received mine through Jax Music Supply, LLCwho were great to deal with, for a fast and reliable service."
"2","Fabulous...","This book was awesome. A fast paced, riveting novel by an author I am coming to find just CANNOT disappoint me. I am hooked on her Carpathians and now find that I will run just as fast to the bookstore when her next gothic comes out.THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a terrific love story and mystery set in a supposedly cursed castle that has everything from grinning gargoyles to an impressive maze. The hero and heroine are just as riveting in their fascinatin for each other and then their entanglement in the mystery of THE SCARLETTI CURSE. I highly recommend this book to all readers, Feehan fan or not. But be warned, by the time you turn the last page of this book you will be hooked on Christine Feehan."
"2","SHE HAS DONE IT AGAIN!!!!!!","OH MY,OH MY,SHE HAS DONE IT AGAIN.TO THE ONES THAT HAVE MS.FEEHAN'S OTHER BOOKS YOU NEED NO INTDUCTION, TO HER FINE WORK.TO THE ONES THAT DON'T KNOW ABOUT HER DARK SERIES .THIS IS A GOOD BOOK TO GET TO KNOW ABOUT MS.FEEHAN WORK.NICOTETTA AND GIOVANNI STORY IS SO POWERFUL,THAT YOU DON'T WANT THIS BOOK TO END,ONLY LOVE AND MAGIC COULD KEEP THEM AT EACH OTHER SIDE.A KEEPER .....4 STARS"
"2","Wonderful!!!","Wonderful book! Very few fans of Feehan's Dark series seem to realize that although this book is not part of the Dark series, is the children and children's children of this couple will tie in to the Dark series later. Bryon's lifemate will come from this line. But if you want to learn about what's going to happen in the future books in this series as well as the Dark series, then go to Feehan's web page. You can use any search engine to get to it. But this book really is wonderful! It can really stand on it's own! I can't wait for more from this author. The publishing company needs to publish her stuff quicker than this! Can't wait till Darius's story, Dark Fire! Feel free for anyone to e-mail with any questions! I'll sell you on these books!"
"2","A change from the Carpathian Series","The heroine, Nicoletta is the village healer. Overlord Don Giovanni exercises his right to select a village girl as his bride and chooses Nicoletta against her wishes. His home, the Palazzio, is a foreboding place, mysterious and frightening to the villagers...a place with a history of death. Giovanni is able to communicate with Nicoletta mind to mind...the only similarity to the Dark Series Heroes...bringing a subtle sensuality to their burgeoning relationship...a welcome change from the ""pounce on each other in the first chapter"" genre. Feehan continues to bring us dark heroes and independant heroines who find love in the sharing of each others gifts."
"2","Riveting","I have really enjoyed Ms. Feehan's Dark series, so was eager to read her new book. This is a true gothic with just enough paranormal elements to help build a relationship between the hero and heroine. Nicoletta has special ""gifts"" which her entire village tries to keep a secret, however, it is the presence of these gifts which draws Don Scarletti to her. He has ""gifts"" of his own. Nicoletta isn't immediately enchanted with the idea of marriage to the Don. Unlike some authors, who use the ""I hate you!"" temper tantrum to ignite passion between the main characters, Ms. Feehan uses the empathy and sensitivity of her characters to achieve it. The love scenes are wonderful, though not very plentiful. So if you're looking for the same amount and intensity of love scenes as in the Dark books, you may be dissappointed. I read this in one sitting and couldn't put it down. The story is riveting."
"1","Not her best...........","Before I begin, let me just say that I absolutely love her Dark series. Those books are great. This one had potential, but it just fell flat. Her characters simply weren't developed enough this time for me to relate to them. This effort was decent but not at all up to her usual standards."
"1","This one is missing that Feehan Spark","This book was a major disappointment. It was missing that special spark that made Ms Feehan's other novels (especially Dark Desire) something special. I found the book had very little action, little romance, and a ""mystery"" plot that was never very mysterious or suspenseful. This is definitely not a book that I will pass on to my friends and family to read."
"2","Intriguing story","While I don't consider it the best of Ms. Feehan's books that I have read, The Scarletti Curse is an intriguing story that is very solid. The protaganists are believable and interesting. If you like Ms. Feehan's books I can recommend this one as an addition to your library."
"2","amazing","I Loved this book. Heart pounding romance and action, keep you going though the whole storie. I say this is a Must Read!"
"1","Too Boring","This book had great potential that it did not live up to. I hope she goes back to writing more ""Dark Series"" books. This book needed more action and more editing - it was way too long for the amount of plot it had. :-("
"1","Ick ack. Put it back.","I absolutely couldn't stand this book!I'm not understanding how it's sexy for a woman to give up her friends and life for a guy who wishes to control her completely. The Don was a jerk. Nicoletta is an awesome heroine in the beginning, but turns into a submissive wifey thing by the end. It's a sad thing when a woman, to paraphrase an actually part of Nicoletta's thoughts, ""leaves her old life behind because he'll never like it, and because she just HAS to"". Eeeeew.I loved the Dark series, and constantly used to stalk the bookstore waiting for the next one. This one was the beginning of the end of my love for Ms. Feehan's work. I bought it to tide me over from one Dark book to the next, and it made me so angry that I wrote the author and got into a big argument over the book!Please, please, please...read something in the Dark series, or Emma Holly's Upyr series. You'll be a lot happier."
"1","disappointed","i was really disappointed with this book. The other ones that she has wrote were very good but this one was dull. it was as if she rushed to put a new book out and didn't take the time to make it interesting. i would still read other books that she writes but i wouldn't read this one again."
"1","Not up to scratch!","I first found Christine Feehan's work through 'Dark Prince'. It was an excellent read and has had me hooked on the whole series! I thought this book would be the same - not even close. The Scarlatti Curse is humdrum. Before I reached halfway I really didn't care about the characters. The secondary characters were underdeveloped and the main characters were two dimensional. I also did not get a feeling for the period or the place. In short it seemed like a short story plot that was enlarged to take advantage of her success with the Carpathian series. Please Christine don't write any more like this."
"2","WONDERFUL GOTHIC","I'm not a gothic reader but i bought this book because i'm a big fan of Christine Feehan.I enjoyed this book very much,it had alot of suspense, paranormal and of course romance. The plot was great,i got hooked from the begining. My only question was it did not reveal how the Scarletti brothers got their gift. Christine Feehan did an excellent job and i'm looking forward for her next book,well done."
"2","YOU HAVE ANOTHER WINNER..... CONGRATULATIONS","CHRISTINE HAS DONE IT AGAIN... THIS BOOK IS AS GOOD AS HER DARK SERIES... WITH JUST ANOUGH SUPERNATURAL ELEMENT - TO SPARK THE INTEREST... OF THOSE PARANORMAL ROMANCE LOVERS. IN HER USUAL STYLE THE CHARACTERS ARE IMMOTIONALY BOUND AND KEEP YOU READING ON AND ON IN ONE SITTING - WITH A CLIMATIC ENDING THIS BOOKS KEEPS YOU QUESSING RIGHT TILL THE END...TRUE GOTHIC WITH CREEPY HOME - WEIRD RELATIVES AND ODD SERVANTS.. I LOVED IT... AND WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED.... CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT GOTHIC - OR ANY OF HER DARK SERIES FOR THAT MATTER.. WELL DONE.."
"2","An Old World change that's definitely wonderful","The Scarletti Curse is absolutely wonderful. Ms. Feehan once again created a lively well written work that stand far apart from her Dark series (which I also adore). With complex and dark characters this book has quite a lot of bite and more than enough romance for a true fan of Christine's work. I highly recommend this book for one and all."
"2","Great Reading","Christine Feehan does it again, for all of you that have only read this one book by her, i strongly suggest that you read them all!"
"1","I really wish i hadn't wasted my time","First, let me say, I'd heard that I might find the Dark Series of Christine Feehan's my cup of tea and for some unknown reason, thought this was one in the series - no need to tell you, I was severely disappointed (and confused).This book really reminded me of the romances my Mother used to read back in the 70's - blech! Lots of dark male broodiness, all written from the heroines point of view, and of course she's a young innocent virgin._____________edited to add: I really wish I had only given this one star, but it appears I can't change that now."
"1","Couldn't finish it","I really like Christine Feehan. This book was very dissapointing. The plot had promise. Nicoletta was a sweet heroine. The prose were good, and the medival Italy setting was an interesting change of pace. However, the plot flows like molasses in January. I managed to get half way through before I through the book down and went back to the 'Dark' series."
"1","Poor support","I've had the camcorder for a while now, and was hoping to be able to use the USB streaming feature to make small computer movies and send them to my friends and family overseas. Although the camcorder is good the included software is weak and the USB streaming makes a very choppy poor quality AVI file. I recently got a new computer and could not find the device driver disk that came with the camcorder. Sony technical support was a joke and they ended up trying to sell me a driver for my camcorder. So now I have a camcorder that I can plug into my TV or record onto a VHS (Do people still use VHS?) but any dreams I have of putting something on my computer are fading fast. I'm going to have to find a new way to send my parents the video I took of my new house.Frankly in this day and age an analogue camcorder is a waste of money."
"2","Very Good","Just as promised, worked well for what I needed. I have some old 8mm tapes and needed a camcorder to play them back on and this fit the bill it also had the USB streaming so I can now transfer them to dvd also the shipping was quick and package great for protection."
"2","Great for the money","The picture on this camera is good and it needs very little light. However, the colors are not quite as accurate as I had hoped for Hi8. Perhaps digital would have been better, but the price was a factor. I shopped around and found Amazon had the best price available."
"1","Low resolution and poor quality","I bought it new in 2002 for $400. The color is pretty good. The resolution is very poor, only close shot get you satified. Other than that you get blur edge and barrel distortion sometimes. I didn't use it a lot for the first 3 years, only the last 2 years I used it regularly to tape my daughter's piano class homework every 2 weeks for 5-8 minutes each time. Recently I have to knock this camera extremly hard several times to make the recording start (It's common issue as the piano teacher told me.). So I have to find a new camcorder now. I don't know what can I do if it refuses to work one day in my daughter's piano class."
"2","Better than some out there.","My one-year-old has played with this toy for several months. He disregards the keys and pulls up on the lids themselves. Not quite what I expected. He's had more fun pulling the lids up and pushing them down again, and only accidentally happens upon the moving keys and the noises they make. The sounds alternate between giggles with music background and animal noises, also not quite what I expected. But it's noise I can deal with. The volume can be adjusted or turned off (through I myself can't distinguish between ""soft"" and ""loud"" on this thing). My son enjoys the toy, but it may be of limited or intermittent interest."
"2","Fun toy!","My 11 month old son received this for Christmas and he loves it. He loves to watch the animals pop up and make noises. It's fun to watch his face light up and hear him squeel with delight when he hits one of the buttons and the animal pops up."
"2","Cruel and Unusual","Cruel and Unusual is the first Patricia Cornwell book I have got read and I for one loved it and I can't wait the read more of her books my boyfriend told me about Patricia Cornwell books he said I need to read Hornet's Nest and Southern Cross and those will be my next two book I will be reading and I will be reading them on my new IPad I got for Christmas I can't wait keep up the great writing Patricia and thanks to my boyfriend for telling me about this awesome writer.........RKsbabydoll"
"2","Good Deal and Fast Shipping","I bought this book used and it was in very good condition. Also, I received it within a week, which was nice."
"1","2/3 of a great book, then... blah","I listened to the audio version of ""Cruel & Unusual"" on a recent trip to New Jersey and back. The first 2/3 of the book kept me on the edge of my seat, then... the whole thing collapsed in a heap at the end. Would have been much better if the author had stuck to writing a taut thriller instead of trying to drag in everything from evil Republican office holders to Nazi war criminals, all dumped into the mix at the last possible moment. After all the buildup, the ""who"" of the whodunnit ends up being... nobody in particular. And the fate of the evildoer? Nothin' much. Disappointing. Won't bother with Dr. Scarpetta or Ms. Cornwall again.I'm a little baffled by all the reviews that say, ""great book, bad ending..."" and still give it 3 stars or more. Isn't a mystery DEFINED by the ending, by how the author ties up all the loose ends and red herrings?"
"2","Review","This book was a bit more difficult to follow, in my opinion. I was lost toward the end. But Patrica is an awesome writer! I'm sure the problem was me, not her writing."
"2","Love Scarpetta","You have to love the Scarpetta series by Cornwell. This is an excellent story full of suspense and humor."
"1","A really bad book","Here is a summary of my impressions:1 It was written for about the 6th grade level.2 There was virtually no ""grab"" for the first 2/3 of the book. I simply trudged through. That is highly unusual for a crime book.3 The author went into excruciating detail about extraneous subject matters. This happened multiple times. You'll feel as though she was just trying to fill pages.4 But most of all, there was no closure to the story in any satisfying way. That is paramount in a good crime book.In summary, don't bother. If you do, you'll be asking the same thing I did, ""I want my 10 hours back that I wasted on this book.""Harris LevinCruel and Unusual: A Kay Scarpetta Novel"
"1","formula type writing","My first foray into this writer was her latest book, Scarpetta. I enjoyed it....so I purchased this effort and several others she had written. I was a bit disheartened to find that all of her books have basically the same formula and character studies. After a while reading her work becomes less than stimulating. It becomes trite."
"1","Just Plain Cruel Will Do","I must say I was required to read this book for a class. If that had not been the case, I would have put the book down half way through it. I was put off by the excessive amounts of technical language and graphic descriptions of the state of murder victims. Quite frankly, I was very disappointed by this book."
"2","Cruel and Unusual","A typical Patricia Cornwell fiction novel, easy to read and a page turner. It gripped me until the end. Enjoy."
"1","I guess it was a mystery","In a word, Lacking. Her style of writing left me unable to appreciate the underlying story which, as a result, I found rather vacuous and inauthentic. So much so that I felt compelled to come write a review of this book so others might avoid making the same mistake I did. No offence Patricia."
"1","Inproper Advertising","I needed to replace a lost CD set of the library CD book: Cruel and Unusual by Patricia Cornwell. The one I ordered from Amazon was listed as a CD set (not as a cassette set) so I ordered it. I received a Cassette set of the book and NOT a CD set of the book. I wrote (through Amazon) to the seller and their reply was that I received a CD set.The Librarians can vouch for what I received as I showed them the envelope and the contents within it. Even though it was my responsibility to replace the CD book (so I wouldn't have to pay the Library charge), I now had to give that job to the library. Need I say more?This time, and it's the first time, Amazon has a very disgruntled customer.Thanks for asking for the review. Maybe Amazon could check into this and prevent others from experiencing what I experienced.Sincerely,Sherry BohmP.S. Yes, my husband and I are still Amazon shoppers. We're just going to have to be more careful now."
"2","Solid Addition to the Series","Like the ones before, this book is a solid forensic and police procedural. A death row inmate is executed and his fingerprint later shows up in a current crime scene. How could that have happened? I particularly enjoyed seeing Kay's niece, Lucy, again, as she is 17 now and her own person, no longer a child. Lucy's computer skills continue to amaze. I look forward to reading the next in the series!(Note: There is a continuing bad guy introduced in this book who appears in the next two installments as well. I'd recommend reading this book before The Body Farm and From Potter's Field)"
"2","Still Loving Scarpetta","I could not give this book a full 5 starts. For whatever reason, the book seemed to ""bog-down"" and I just wanted it to end. I will continue to read the series, but this one was not my favorite."
"2","Great","Well paced novel with interesting characters and plenty of plot twists. Patricia Cornwell writes characters that are real and have depth. Her mastery of criminal science is wonderful and offers a sense of authenticity that few authors achieve."
"2","Another one done!!!","Very very good!!....I can usually figure out who did it, not this time. so many complicated twists and turns. Great read!!!"
"2","Cruel and Unusual","The book was excellent. I was barely able to put it down. I love the Kay Scarpetta series and am excited when I get to read more."
"1","Muddled ending disapoints","The good: The basic plot line is interesting- a man who has just been killed by the electric chair has his finger print turn up at a murder scene. The writing itself is good. The main character Kay Scarpetta and an old professor of hers are well `fleshed out'.The bad: Other characters are not well `fleshed out'. The plot never fully explains itself. Is the book about figuring out how a dead criminal could commit crimes - or is it about Scarpetta - redeeming herself in the eyes of everyone around her - after developing an anti-social workaholic tendency after the death of a loved one? The latter seems to be the path the author choose - leaving some of the twist in the plot unresolved. Though others in the story have made Scarpetta out to be the villain (on many different levels - as a family member, as a friend and as a professional) in the end her `goodness' is redeemed. How the bad guys in the story turn out seems to be unimportant - which I found to be a major flaw."
"2","Spellbound!","This was my first Patricia Cornwell novel and I must say I was blown away. I never thought I'd warm up to a modern mystery writer the way I did with Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers, but Ms. Cornwell has displaced them both in my heart.C & E was by far the most fascinating book I've ever read. I sat up until the wee hours of the morning reading this wonderful novel, devouring every word, as I couldn't go to bed until I had finished it. The only disappointment was the ending. The killer came out of the blue, and there were too many loose ends.The story and characters were first rate and I intend to read all her other books. It's been a long time since I found an author I would be willing to pay hardcover prices to read."
"2","Very nice book","I really liked this book. It is a page turner for sure. I would read before I went to bed and have to force myself to find a stopping point.I think that Patricia Cornwell is at her prime in this novel."
"1","Too scattered, too shallow","Although this might be a good book to introduce issues in technical writing to someone considering the field, it is not useful if you want anything more than a broad overview. The information it contains varies widely in depth and is sometimes dated; for example, there are several paragraphs discussing the features of dot-matrix printers but only one short and incomplete list of the types of bindings available for professionally printed documentation. For some unclear reason, two sections on editing are separated by 10 pages on usability testing. If you are actually involved in technical writing, there are better books."
"1","Soooooooooooo NOT Funny","This movie was not only NOT funny, but it was excruciatingly boring. I think Adam was channeling the Aristocrats. Whilst Aristocrats was not as funny as it thought itself to be, it was still better than this garbage."
"1","Totally Unfunny","When the film first started playing, my partner and I looked at each other as if to say ""What on earth is this?..."" but we decided to give it a chance and let it play - for about half an hour before we couldn't bare to watch any more. The title says 'Funny' - it wasn't. The overall cover is totally misleading and gives you the impression it is a funny film by someone who had previously done a funny film - but it was in no way funny at all. The jokes were terrible, the script was terrible. Very disappointing."
"1","Nasty People! Nasty Film!","Entertaining in places but spoilt by lots of crudeness and dirty talk that degrades woman. In the end I found nothing memorable or funny about this film. Sad for Adam to seem him in such a trashy film."
"1","zero star","those guys ARE OVERATED!! ARE THEY REALLY FUNNY? NOPE. STUDIOS PAY THEM MILLIONS OF DLSS FOR THIS!!! C'MON AMERICA.. WAKE UP!!!"
"1","Dramedy","This movie was perhaps Adam Sandler's worst effort. He seemed tasked with the burden of playing a man who was apathetic, but he came across as being apathetic about the role. The result was that his performance never engaged viewers to want to pull for him, which made the climax of the film lackluster. It was occasionally funny, considering the title and cast of comedians, who played comedians. The last 45 minutes, the film changes pace entirely, as if it wasn't floundering enough, and drops its attempts at weak comedy to push even weaker drama. Despite all the big names and cameo appearances, the only real stand out was Leslie Mann, who plays Sandler's ex. She was the only lively force in the cast, but sadly, alone she wasn't enough to bring it back into focus. You're not missing a thing."
"1","The Not so Funny People","I love Leslie Mann and Eric Bana, but this is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It was like 3 or 4 movie/plots/stories put together and just kept climaxing then letting down then rising action again and climax and letting down; over and over! I just kept wondering when it was going to end. I should have walked out like so many others did.Some may like, but it's NOT my cup of tea!"
"1","What happend Sandler?","His movies seem to be going down hill. The only thing i found funny about this movie was Eminem snapping in it. Other then that, it is just not that funny. Dont let it trick you, only see this if its free."
"2","serious comedy","FUNNY PEOPLE is somewhat compelling and engaging film about a comic with a terminal illness that almost kills him and destroys his lifestyle and how he fights it and comesback to enjoy life,his friends and a beautifull woman he meets."
"1","Long, somewhat dull and unfocused","This is not a typical Adam Sandler movie, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it kind of is here. First of all it's not funny. It's about ""comedy"" but I wouldn't consider the movie itself to be a comedy, although there are a few funny things in it I suppose. This movie seems like it's all over the place. It has a long runtime but it doesnt really accomplish much. Some people might like the story, but it was pretty dull to me."
"1","WHICH JOKE DID YOU FIND FUNNY?","Adam Sadler plays an unlikable comedian, George Simmons, who finds out he may be terminal with AML and tries an experimental drug. He decides to do stand up again when he meets comedian wanna-be Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) attempting stand-up. Sadler is impressed by Ira and hires him to write jokes and to be his personal go-fer. Ira finds out about the illness and convinces George to tell his family and friends about it. George plays the death card to patch up relationships, then suddenly he isn't going to die anymore. George re-examines his life, but even at mid-life he is still an immature a-hole. Everyone has sex but Ira, which seems to be a sad joke.I found the jokes and humor to be at best, lame. The language was crude and sexual. Brief nudity. Perhaps what is best about the movie is that it makes sit-coms look really lame. If you think a guy saying ""tweet"" over and over again, spinning around in a circle is funny, then this movie is for you."
"2","Far better than its reputation, and well worth a look","Intelligent, funny, sad, real, with a terrific dramatic performance by Adam Sandler.For a lot of it's length I thought it would be a truly great film, but some clunky, almostsit-com plot turns in the last 1/4, a little too much length, and not-quite-there supportingperformances in key roles hold it back and keep it a very good movie, not a great one.None-the-less, far better than the often cold response in got in most of the mainstream press."
"1","Starts out with promise, but then goes downhill.","Too bad Adam Sandler could not have been given a better script. Funny People starts with promise as a Jim Carrey Man on the Moon type film and then drifts oddly into some sort of romantic comedy with repetitive c**k jokes. There are two movies here made from what seems like two first drafts. Maybe it is a marketing problem. Or, maybe just lazy writing. Sandler does a great job showing off the dark side of a comedian. Maybe Funny People would have been better as a straight drama."
"1","Not so Funny people!","Wow, I usually like Adam Sandler & Judd Apatow/Seth Rogen films but this one came and left the theaters before I could get a chance to see it. I don't think I laughed once during the entire movie. Not even a chuckle. It seems as if no one was having any fun making this film. The unnecessary over the top crudeness of Apatow's ensemble doesn't seem to work with Sandler's schtick. I loved ""Knocked Up"" and ""40 Year Old Virgin"" but there doesn't seem to bee much chemistry with this group. I was waiting for ""Bruno"" to show up and throw in some more unnecessary genital conversation. I almost bought this, I'm so glad I only rented it."
"1","Obviously, not Adam Sandler's best","An acceptable movie, with some good moments by Adam Sandler, and some of the other new American comedy guys; but very far from his really ""funny people"" involved movies, like ""ANGER MANAGEMENT"" (with Jack Nicholson) or the hilarious ""LITTLE NICKY""."
"1","Not what I expected...","I seriously did not expect a dramatic look into the mind of a comedian when I rented this movie. They marketed this movie like the Forty Year Old Virigin and Knocked Up! When I rented the movie I expected a lot of humour and with so many funny actors I put way too much faith in it. My wife and I was so disappointed that we stopped watching it. I don't watch a lot of TV, but when I do watch something I want it to be worth while.If you're into these artsy films about the serious life of people in the spotlight, then you're going to like this film. However, if you're looking for humour like Adam Sandler's previous films (i.e. Happy Gilmore, etc) then you can forget about it.I give this film 1 star because this is not my kind of movie and it was advertised like a great comedy film not drama film. :/"
"1","Couldn't give it less than one star....or i would've!!!!","Not much to say about this movie...i am a huge Adam Sandler fan, and i love him in anything....but this movie was looooong and booooring!!! The comedy skits in the movie weren't funny...at all...i guess if you enjoy hearing about masturbating...cocks...and farting....you would like it. Like i said, not much to say....i paid to watch it on my Suddenlink Direct Demand and i wish i could have my 3.99 back!!!!"
"1","Absolutely NOTHING Funny !","This is one of the worst movies I have seen. The dialogue is awful. There is ZERO humor. All the characters are boring and completely humorless.What a loser movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"1","Worst movie I've ever seen","This movie was HORRIBLE! I don't know how anyone could give it 5 stars. This movie was the worst 2 hours of my life. I expected more out of an Adam Sandler movie. I felt like I was watching 2 movies at once. Any time someone asks me about this movie I tell them it's a waste and to rent something else."
"1","worst film ever","I saw this movie with my friend a couple of days ago. i said to her, this is real stupid, i could stop watching it right now and i could care less about the ending. She said, ""we saw this movie already"" and she is telling me what happens next so we start getting into an argument, she claims WE saw it and i said, Vat ? i am getting alzheimers?Finally we figured it out. we started to watch this movie together about 3 months ago and i lost interest and i zonked out.adam sandler and all the whos who in jewish comedy were funny in other movies. but this one really eats the bird!skip it!!!!!!!!!!!"
"1","The L O N G E S T movie... EVER!","Anything with Adam Sandler in it is supposed to be funny. This however, just, well, wasn't. I really do believe that this movie had potential, but there was so much going on, so many stories within the story, that they could have made 3 movies out of it.It's 2 and a half hours long. That's about an hour and a half too long for the main story plot. This movie honestly seemed longer than Titanic, or Gone With The Wind because it is so long and drawn out.There is very little humor in Funny People. The only good thing about it is all the major stars that pop up here and there, which is probably why, in my opinion at least, that this movie even made it to the big screen and didn't go straight to DVD."
"1","profanity the movie!!! or profanity and the degenerates.!!!","i cannot believe that an intelligent actor like adam sandler would degrade himself by acting in a degenerate , trailer trash movie like this,but i guess money makes some people do things that are beneath them. this movie is as funny as a sewer, all it is comprised of is endless and pointless profanity,virtually ever second word. the writer who has very little ,if not any intelligents, has substituted profanity for lack of intelligent writing.is the endless profanity suppose to make the male lead charactors appear more manly?. yes it is true that quentin tarantino movies has there fair share of profanity. however his movies use of profanity is justified as it is incorporated with intelligent writing. if you have very little or no intelligents or are a degenerate and trailer trash this movie will appeal to you."
"1","Seth Kept this movie from getting a 'ZERO' star rating!!","A truly great example - of how terrible some movies have become!! Vulgar!! Offensive. Unnessisary nudity!! I usually love Adam Sandler - and can't believe he'd stoop so low in this role. Seth is highly likeable in this - but still swears and lowers himself as well. The woman who plays Adams 'romantic interest' is mostly great - but also stoops to swearing - blantant sexuality. The writing is the worst in this movie. This awful movie is 2 hours and 22 minutes long - but only feels like 5 hours. - And I could have spent my life doing something more interesting and exciting like watching paint dry or grass grow. I suggest skipping this movie altogether!! Tragic where movies have gone to. Much has been lost!!Scott MacNeil - comedian."
"1","Stupid....","Honestly if you don want to hear a lot of swearing you wont like this. Let alone the story line was ridiculous. Wouldn't recommend!"
"1","Sandler's worst!","I normally love Sandler's movies but this was just horrible. None of it flowed right, jokes were horrible vand stupid and just all around made no sense. Don't waste your time and money on this."
"1","Not good","The movie skips a few scene transitions and once it got to chapter 15 I couldn't watch any of the rest of the movie at all and the file online said it was 'like new.' The disc itself looks clean but it will not play at all in my 2 week old player and three other players I tried it in......."
"2","GIFT","I bought this for a Christmas present for my son. It arrived in perfect condition. He loves Adam Sandler and collects all his movies."
"1","waste of time","I must say I never liked Adam Sandler. There were so many more talented people who just never got a chance to be on the screen. I still don't get what's with Adam Sandler.Besides that I decided to give it a shot. It took half hour when I stopped watching."
"1","Depressing then becomes boring","my husband and I watched this and ended up watching something else. this will be a waste of your time"
"1","Please just run far FAR away from this film.","It is wayyyyyyyy too long and completely aimless. Some may call it ""complex""; but I call it crap. There are a few little laughs here and there - but nothing that would make this worth sitting through. Even when one steps away from the fact that this was not intended to just be a comedy and rather attempts to tackle some more serious content.....it still sucks. Don't waste your money. Watch ""I love you man"" or ""Grandma's Boy"" or something that is actually entertaining. I wish someone had warned me."
"1","THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!","Judd Apatow has reached an absolutely new level of... sucking!!! Even Adam Sandler, one of my favorite actors of all times, sucked too, big time!!! There are funny movies, there are not so funny ones, there are stupid and ridiculous flix and... there's Funny People! Its name should be changed to ... what's the word for utterly unfunny? Almost 100% of jewish actors and they couldn't pull it off? That's odd!?"
"1","Moron","How can anybody even smile with the kind of garbage Adam Sandler ALWAYS performs?This guy is just a moronic retard.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON HIM."
"1","NOT FUNNY!","This is what Hollywood is calling humor these days? Must of been written by the lowly out of work writers during their strike! Crude, demeaning and a waste of my time!"
"1","Pretty pathetic people","The new ""stars of comedy"" make me miss the real ones. Why don't you try to learn from thy elders, like Mel Brooks, boys?Side note: Hollywood hasn't come up with real comedy since ""Meet the Spartans."" Anybody who forgot how brilliant it was needs to watch again ""I Will Survive"" at the end of the Spartans (it might still be on Youtube: SidgzLnh_W4)."
"2","great movie, movie is longer than 2hours","this is a great movie its not 40yr old virgin funny or knocked up funny but its a pretty good movie alot of famous ppl in it has alot of good funny parts 2 it. the only reason i think its not really funny is because theres none of those funny parts like knocked up of the 40yr old virgin has. dont pay attention to the reviews rent the movie or something if u like it buy it."
"2","Not entirely a comedy","I am big fan of Judd Apatow's work. i went into this hearing that its not like his other movies, that it has a more somber, serious tone. so my expectations were tempered. I liked it, i do agree with some other reviewers that it was probably a little too long, which is why I take off one star. But if you go in knowing this isnt a 40 year old virgin/knocked up style comedy then you wont be disappointed. with that being said, i can see why some people rated this poorly if thats what they thought they were going to see going in."
"1","Winning Cast, movie fell short","This movie was not an original concept. The jokes were lame, as were the performances. The writer and director disappointed the audience by using Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill as a box office draw. When in fact, it wasn't worth the money to see this film in a theatre."
"1","ACTUALLY NO STARS for rating pf Funny People movie","Save your money. Your time can be MUCH better spent. This was one of the worse movies I ever sat through. Actually, I drifted away close to the end and was thankful I didn't waste that time. Its AWFUL."
"1","Not Funny People","Not worth the time.Pros: there were several good one-liners; introduced me to new comediansCons: excess foul language; adultry;"
"2","Very inspirational","So I just watched Funny People. For a movie that has an all star cast, it was a great movie. If you want to see a movie filled with laughs and a good story pick this movie up. I promise you won't regret it."
"2","Sfar's Best!","A delightfully funny story! A wonderful graphic novel that gives us a cat's-eye view of the Sephardic Jewish community in Algeria and then the Algerian community in Paris in the early 20th Century. It's a love story. Very funny and endearing. And the hero is a cat! This is a must for Joann Sfar fans."
"2","The Rabbi's Cat is the cat's meow!","This book came highly recommended to me by my Rabbi's husband. I was not disappointed! I think everyone will love this illustrated novel.Jorma"
"2","A wonderful, funny-sad book","The Rabbi's Cat is a wonderful book. I heard the author speak on NPR and got the book. The book is in the form of a comic strip, each box lovingly illustrated by the author. The pictures are wonderful, particularly of the cat. They are a joy to behold.Even better are the stories, anecdotes taken from the lives of the Jews in North Africa in the thirties. The stories are both very sad and hysterically funny. The cat has a sardonic turn of phrase that had me in stitches. Through the difficult medium of comics, the author has managed to capture the atmosphere of the time and place. Much of the book is given to musings about life, philosophy, love, God and so on. If you like a good discussion, you'll enjoy this book.Although the books can be enjoyed by non-Jews, I think if you don't know the basics of Judaism, you'll be missing the most vital part of the book. Of course, the book is so appropriate for the cat lover. The author clearly understands cats perfectly."
"2","good artwork too!","The review with all the details about the depth and levels of the story hits the mark so I won't repeat it. However, I will emphasize what was not commented on. The Author is a very talented artist. He takes risks on many pages and it works, resulting in a feast of creative colorful dynamic drawings to accompany the text. The story wanes a bit in the final pages but the trip is artistically very satisfying. I hope there is a book to follow. I really enjoyed the characters and how they delt with their world and their beliefs."
"2","Delightful, exotic world seen through a cat's eyes","""The Rabbi's Cat,"" by French artist and filmmaker Joann Sfar, is a whimsical, charming fable featuring a rabbi, his lovely daughter, and a host of other characters headed by a talking cat. Both protagonist and narrator, the cat often acts as a Greek chorus who comments, often sardonically, on the actions of the humans around him. Set in pre-World War II Algeria, with a lengthy detour to Paris, the beautifully illustrated narrative depicts a richly diverse world in which individuals seek to preserve their traditions while constantly interacting with people of other cultural, social and religious backgrounds. In this multilayered environment, the presence of an intelligent talking cat does not seem entirely out of place."
"1","Self-Serving Message","This is the tale of a kindly Rabbi, his sweet daughter and the cat who loves her. The tale seems promising at first, until it delves into bitterness over God and those who love Him and follow His laws. The cat represents the glorification of sin itself, and delights whenever the book's characters fall into ungodly habits, judging them forever as hypocrites (taking no account into repentance and future avoidance of said sin). As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God. At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi, thus giving the tale a 'happy ending'. In short, 'The Rabbi's Cat' is a tale structured to appeal to secular humanists, atheists and pagans who want to feel better about their self-serving, do as you feel, lifestyles.One more note: This book, despite the beautiful artwork and appealing cover, is definitely not appropriate for children."
"1","Not what it looks like on the cover.","As someone who is interested in different cultures, I thought the book would be an interesting window into other people's thoughts. Instead, I open it to find a swearing cat (he uses the F word) denigrating religion and showing religious people as hypocrites, in a lame stereotypical way. Might be interesting to others, but its not interesting to me. Not only is it not suitable to children, but there are a lot of adults who would not want to be bothered with this kind of disrespect and vulgarity either. I wish I had been warned before I tried to read this book."
"2","The Last dissenting Witness","The way Bill Sloan wrote Jean Hill's side of her story of the assassination was in perfect terms. Jean Hill was the closest person to President Kennedy when the shots were fired and she saw where the shots came from and the feds tried to cover everything up. I believe that Jean Hill really knew and saw what happened that day in November. Anyone who would like to find out information about the assassination I believe this is the right book to read and hear what was truly covered up."
"1","See my article ""Jean Hill - The Lady in Red"" online","Since writing my review of JFK: THE LAST DISSENTING WITNESS in 1998, I have been able to have my 35-page article - ""Jean Hill -The Lady in Red"" - included in Clint Bradford's JFK Assassination website. The address is: http://www.jfk-info.com/sitemap1.htm (scroll down for title)."
"1","Drivel","Jean Hill's story changed with the wind. She saw next to nothing during the assassination, but used her unique location (and her active imagination)to keep herself in the limelight for years. It got so bad that even the conspiracy writers were shying away from her toward the end. It was laughable.Someone needed to ask her about the ""little dog"" she said was sitting in the car with JFK and Jackie. (Look at the original interviews- she actually said it.)This book is BS from stem to stern. Go read a fairy tale, at least there's a moral at the end. The only thing you find at the end of this book is your wallet a little lighter!"
"1","An Ever expanding story followed by same ol same ol","Very disappointing read. Starts with her tale of what she saw in 1963 then devolves into another ""MASSIVE GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY"" work. Offering no documentation to support statements made. Unsupported statements about what her boyfriend said, claimed or saw. Lauds Garrison and his persecution of an innocent man in New Orleans. Originally I thought &#65533;The Assassination tapes&#65533; By George O&#65533;Toole was the worst effort in Conspiracy volumes but no more."
"1","Uneducated Nonsense","The physics department at my school gets the mad ramblings of this man, and I usually end up with them (seeing as how no one else will read them). In a word, I sum these writings as ""nonsense."" Most of his ideas, aside from being mostly incoherant and physically absurd, also defy the time-tested and true concepts that the average high-school physics student could debunk. Furthermore, mixed in with these insane babblings, are religious and political ramblings, which he tries to pass off as the only possible truth.My recommendation, unless you want a good laugh or evidence of the under-education of many Americans, pass on this book. Any other use of your money would be a better one."
"2","Great Swords for a Great Price!","I ordered the set of swords on December 9th (Sunday) and recieved the swords today (Wednesday, the 12). The Shipping was absolutly BLAZING! UPS Shipped with a Tracking Number made me confident in Sword Demon. Packaging was great and everything was alright. I would deffiently buy from Sword Demon again.These swords are UNSHARPENED. It would appear that Stainless Steel is not very good for sharpening them either. These are really ""Wallhanger"" katana's, But when your buddies come over and see them, they almost cry. These are just the coolest swords because of the movie. All the symbols and words on the blades are actually etched. The symbols and the like are the exact same from the movie."
"1","Fraud,not as advertised","This DVD was entiled ""Seventh Cliburn Competion, 1985"" It was not the competion program, and did not even contain the winning performance. I consider it to be a total fraud and misrepresentation."
"1","Impossible to read","This kindly adaptation is a mishmash of gibberish. Amazon really needs to take more time in converting these. In this condition this should be free."
"2","Nice size","Very good amount for the price. Smells nice too. However, the smell reminds me of clean laundry. I was wanting something a little different, a little younger. Still smells pretty good though. Curve smells better in the men cologne to me."
"1","Still haven't received item","Bought for my mom for Christmas she loves this perfume and it does actually smell pretty good however I was supposed to recieve my order by the 20th at the latest.its now the night of the 22nd and I am very worried it wont be here for Christmas. UPDATE: Spoke with Amazons customer service and they are replacing my missing item. It will be here tomorrow. Still sucks cuz it wasn't here in time for christmas, however I'm just glad they are replacing it for me."
"2","Curve","It smells like Gap heaven, Very nice. Beautiful color and scent! Can't wait to try Curve Crush when i'm done with this one."
"2","Good value","I love Curve and this is a large bottle which make is a very good value. Highly recommended."
"1","Unsatisfying ending disappoints the reader","The plot develops nicely then ends abruptly with an unsatisfying ending. It seems to the reader as if the author had reached her contractual page limit and slapped an ending onto the book. A superhuman villian was terminated too easily. The method of capture was not adequately developed. Several promising themes were not followed up by the author, especially the entriquing possibility that through genetic testing Gault's uncle may have been his father or the reason for the military being interested in the investigation. The author took one of the least interesting possibilites and handled it in a below average formulaic manner"
"2","The Best Patricia Cornwell's book","I have read all Patricia Cornwell's book, and I think Ms. Cornwell has reached her best in writing this book.Suspense, mystery, New York, they all contribute to keep you awake until you finish the book."
"1","Kay Scarpetti is losing it.","Here is a character I have enjoyed develop. But Kay is losing it. She should dump her niece Lucie, clean up her personal life (it's not nice to have an affair with a friends husband) and treat Det. Marino with some respect.As for Gault, if I pick up another Scarpetti book with his name in it... right back on the shelf"
"1","If you can't say anything nice,","Well, that's no fun. Honesty is the best policy, right? This was the first of Patricia's books I had the displeasure to become acquainted with. I've tried reading another of her works, but I can't get over the simplistic writing with unnecessary adjectives thrown in for no apparent reason except, perhaps, to make the sentences longer and make the reader suffer from the protracted tripe. More than that, this book failed to make me care about the characters or about the outcome of the story"
"2","Great read","This book is a great read, a lot of fun. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes the genre. On the down side, I think that Gault is a little too evil -- he borders on the implausible with his ability to be one step ahead of the game. Also, I think Cornwell needs to develop Dr Kay a bit more; she's a good character, but needs more depth"
"1","You have GOT to be kidding","This could be the worst novel I have ever read. It is also the first and last Patricia Cornwell novel I will ever read. There are so many problems with this book that they cannot be listed here, so here are but three points: 1) The main character, Kay Scarpetta, is an insufferable, humorless snob. I'd never before read a novel where I hated the main character. Great job, Pat! 2) About 90% of the novel is dialogue. Very bad dialogue. But this is understandable since Cornwell cannot write prose. 3) The story is predictable and boring, and the ending is utterly ridiculous. I'm astonished that this book was ever published, let alone made the bestseller lists."
"1","My brain froze over","This supposed ""thriller"" is mind-numbingly dull and inept - I had to give up half way through."
"1","Losing her edge?","I loved Patricia Cornwell's first five novels; sadly, her sixth loses its edge.. I wanted to enjoy it.. but the plot labors on.. and I had a hard time finishing a book I couldn't wait to read. We lose Scarpetta's forensic ""grit"" and instead focus on a bizarre, rather boring computer plot.. I hope the next books in the series are better!"
"1","The devil in the detail","I'm not a fan of the crime writing genre, so I require more than some blood and guts and a few nasty frights to make me speak highly of a crime novel. Unfortunately, I cannot speak highly of From Potter's Field.I know more about dogs than I do about forensic medicine, so it makes me suspicious of the novel's factual integrity when I read that a murderer's eyes are ""as pale blue as a malamute's"", when in fact (according to the Alaskan Malamute Club of America), a malamute's eyes MUST be brown, never blue.It also made me laugh to think that all the crime agencies (and the media!!) in the USA would be completely ignorant regarding the closest relatives of the country's highest profile serial killer. Although if the good guys had known some basic details about the killer's family tree, Dr Kay would have been left twiddling her thumbs, so I suppose I should quit complaining.Well, I read the book right through to the end, and it kept me amused, so I have to give it one star."
"1","The pits . . . a contrived pot-boiler. Avoid it.","If you love meaningless running around, plot lines thatdefy even sympathetic attempts to suspend disbelief, andsnarled bureacratic conflicts among different law enforcement agencies, you might put up with this one. Otherwise . . . the book disappoints. One gets the impression that it was written in haste. A pale imitation of the previous work . . .deserves to be piled high on the remainder tables (if not in a Potter's Field for books)."
"1","So far, the worst book of one of my favorite authors","Having read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, I was very disappointed about her latest achievment. Draging the villain through 3 separate books probably wasn't her best idea. Even more disturbing: The characters of her main heros (Scarpetta, Marino, Lucie) were described inconsistent with her previous books"
"1","Very Dissapointing","From Potters Field is one Patricia Cornwell's worst book she has written. It's not the characters, nope. It's not the writing that is wrong. It's the story that makes the book disappointing.Temple Gault has struck again. This time we know this for sure. Both the readers and Kay Scarpetta do. Someone from Lucy's past is also back. The problem with this book is that Gault is not a strong enough villain to carry this book. He is not scary or very threatening. It's not exiting. Partly because we never get into his head we are always inside Scarpetta's. Even if Cornwell did venture inside his head I'm not sure if it would be that exiting. For a killer on the loose plot its very weak, of coarse the forensics are very good and original. But for the most part a very disappointing Scarpetta novel."
"2","Intelligently written; a fast and suspenseful read.","I am on my 8th Scarpetta story. I most enjoy the relationships Cornwell develops.....Marino's gruff demeanor and language are so colorful...Dr. Kay is a strong female figure who uses her brain to handle the men who would take her down...The development of Lucy's character is interesting, but it is time she, too, develop into a stronger person emotionally. Cornwell's work is, for me, as good as Grisham's."
"1","What a disappointment!","I expected better than this poorly contrived story of murder and mystery from a well-seasoned author. The plot line lacked substance and the ending was poorly executed. The only reason I continued reading the story was in hopes that it would improve as I read. Boy, was I disappointed."
"1","Just awful","This was possibly the worst book I have ever read. I am amazed by the number of fans for this kind of rubbish."
"1","A wildly implausible thriller","This book is so unrealistic that it spoils all the fun, super killers like Temple Gault (a clone for the Satan Incarnate known as Hannibal Lecter) are more silly than super. I found all the other character two dimensional and all the ""intrigue"" regarding super computers insulting to my intelligence. Has Cornwell done better? I don't know and, after reading this, am in no big hurry to find out."
"2","From Potter's field, buried with no name","Christmas is always a notoriously bad time for Kay Scarpetta, Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia and consulting forensic pathologist for the FBI. When Temple Gault, a cunning serial killer whose killing spree began in Richmond several years earlier, resurfaces in New York with the murder of a female transient left in frozen Central Park, Scarpetta jumps head first into the investigation. The identity of the homeless woman becomes top priority, and when it is discovered who she is, the investigation is spun into a radical new direction. Meanwhile, Gault has set his sights on Scarpetta herself...leading to one final, terrifying encounter in the fetid tunnels below the city.A fascinating book with wonderful characterization, grisly accuracy and a high-voltage, suspensful ending. The Scarpetta series is the best! When it comes to crime fiction, no one does it better than Cornwell."
"1","Impressive delivery but plot lacking in believability","This was the first Patricia Cornwell book I have read. She is a compelling storyteller, and she obviously possesses great knowledge of the subject matter. I do admit to finishing the book in a two-day period, but it was more to get to the inevitable final showdown between Scarpetta and the killer. Scarpetta and some of her cronies are characterized well, but the killer seemed a bit stereotypical. I don't believe in reading ahead and spoiling the surprise, but in this case I skipped some detailed sections to find out how the killer would be stopped in his tracks.Since reading this book, I have read Cause of Death by Cornwell and would rate that book slightly higher than this one. This book is not her best that I've read so far, but it wouldn't prevent me from reading another one.This is a good, focused, and knowledgable writer who does not need to fall back on unbelievable killers and sensantional plot devices to tell an imaginative story."
"1","No one will edit this, because I'm Patricia Cornwell","At least, that's how I felt about this book, which seems only to have been published because the author has written some truly interesting previous novels. I recommend the first three books in the series. I cannot recommend this book for anything except kindling. However, not having a fireplace, I filed this under G."
"1","a let down","This books just didn't do it for me. I enjoy PC but this book. Seemed too easy. Things just happend, people just called. In fact, I think this books had some bad editing. I felt as though all what was needed was there, and that someone just yanked out the big sections for no reason.I am still a fan, but this one is a skipper.The doc just happens, to see the resturante that the killer was using.The polices offer in charge is left in the subway with two people who are not police. Just does not at add."
"1","To contrived and therefore not plausible","I found this plot to be to contrived in that many of the scenes were just to clearly made up for me to become vicariously involved. The twists and turns in the plot were simply to convenient for me to appreciate a sense of natural flow that good novels must have. For example: The scene in which Gault (the killer) has been seen using the same restaurant that the main character spontaneously finds herself in. Imagine, in New York no less! Not only that, but the killer is using the main characters visa in the same restaurant. And then the genius software engineer niece who just happens to be working on a huge computer program in the law enforcement field. I'm sorry, but this tale is just to unbelievable. It might make a passable B grade film, but I wouldn't want to see it."
"1","Stilted and Hokey","This book reads like the tin man in the Wizard of Oz walked BEFORE he was oiled! Jerky and clumsy with a very hollow ring to it. I read 1/3 of the book and threw it in the ""yard sale"" pile. It's the first book of hers I've read and I don't intend to pick up a second one. This is really a prime example of bad writing churned out for non-readers and quick profits."
"2","Terror in Central Park","Here is a terrifying novel by Cornwell. Her knowledge of medicine and forensic science keeps you turning the page. A woman's body is found in the snow in Central Park. There is no question that the killer is one Temple Brooks Goult. Scarpetta discovers that his killings are a pattern with one ending. It is one of her best. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
"2","Patricia Cornwell rocks! Best mystery writer on record!","Like all of her Scarpetta mystery novels, Patricia Cornwell has proven again that she must have been one dynamite of a Coroner when she was practicing. She has a wealth of information in her books and it is so interesting to follow as she progresses to solving the mystery. I've never enjoyed reading as much as when I pick up a Cornwell novel."
"2","Rekindling Love","Mistakes can never be undone, but rectification is possible. Years after their marriage died, Ross and Tessa are drawn back together when one of their sons is diagnosed with a fatal illness. Returning to what has not been his home in a long time, Ross is met with a mix of hostility, need, and love. Before much time passes, he realizes that his son is not the only one in need of healing. With a society that has been torn apart by issues just like this, the potential audience for it is vast. Mistakes are not glossed over, but proven not to be fatal. This will give hope to thousands."
"1","Worst English dub of a great TV series","This sucked!The WORST English dub EVER!Crayon Shinchan is long TV series that lasted close to 12 years in Japan. Funimation did NOT purchase the entire series just a handful of episodes, so you don't see how the stories and characters developed and changed over the many seasons.The English dub they made changed the entire dialogue and Americanized practically ALL the characters and situations to an extreme low brow humor. Granted the original show did have a lot of puns, and low brow humor as well, but Shinchan did retain an innocence for his mischief, being the focus that he was always this incredible force of fun shaped as a 5 year old boy. True fans of the manga and series should NOT buy this lame production by Funimaiton."
"1","A Piece of Crap!","Noisy, crude five point vibration pad.NOT! a massager, a vibration pad!We purchased three of these and we sent back three of these!Worthless, no, worse than worthless!"
"1","No theory what so ever","The authors seem unaware of the fact that theory guides our understanding. There are no ""objective"" facts, yet the authors present all their findings as such with almost no reasoning attached. This is both arrogant and ignorant. The authors display no grasp of theoretical advances in Accounting and I recommend getting a book that has a better exposition of principles as more than practice"
"1","You sure can tell this was written by an accountant...","There sure is some exciting literature out there. This is not it. The material is very dry...desert comes to mind. I am using this book for my accounting 211 course at OSU, and boy is it fun (note the sarcasm). And what's with the dates in the example problems (such as 12/31/x1)? What is that? Were they too afraid to put a 9 in there? They didn't think we, the students, could handle it? But hey, I'm not bitter or anything. I don't even think you COULD make accounting interesting. A must read! (HA!)"
"1","wrong item","I was going to get a book with a ISN number of 0072316373...But today, I got one with 0070412901...So I need you send my money beac to my account, and give me a well reason why you let the seller mail me a totally different book again, It is the second time I get an item with wrong number"
"1","Worthless","How this man has managed to write so many books while knowing nothing about 1) travel and 2) archaeology is a mystery to me. First he shows up in Jordan with no local money on a Friday (you'd think someone passing themselves off as a knowledgeable traveller would have figured out banks in an Arab country are closed on the Muslim sabbath) Then he continues on with a series of quack theories about aliens, and technologically advanced ancient civilizations, and harps that make rocks float. There not even good quack theories, like Hancock or Buval (who, while equally worthless, at least make an attempt to back up their theories) Read something else."
"2","There's no other book like this one!","There is no other book on Africa, or Arabia, like this one! Like in his other books, Childress rambles from place to place looking for mysteries, lost cities, and adventure. If you are looking for some dry fossil hunter story, this isn't it. It's the only book that I know of that covers such unusual topics as port cities in the middle of the Arabian Desert, the history of the Ark of the Covenant, the giant megaliths of the Kalahari Desert and other little-discussed topics. Lots of old maps, photos and illustrations. It is a fun book to browse through as well."
"1","Don't bother!","What a disappointment. This book is about 50% self-centered travelogue and 50% teasers about the mysteries. I expected a book full of archeological information about cities and cultures that have long since disappeared, but instead got embarrassingly ridiculous chit-chat and superficial explanations. I wanted scientific information, not a book that tends to explain most of its mysteries via levitation and alien beings!"
"2","Lincoln and his time","For the mpost part any book by David Donald is worth the time and effort to read. This book offers fresh insights into the perception of Lincoln. Belongs on the shelf of every person interested in 19th century America."
"2","Explains why economics and politics don't mix!","Hazlitt's view is simple: economics can only be understood if we look at the effects on everyone over time. He views most government economic tinkering as myopic: focussing only on one group of people for a moment. He shows how government intervention--well intentioned as it might be--always hurt people in general over the long-term including the people we mean to help. He champions the forgotten man--the people who are hurt when the governmet tries to improve on the workings of the marketplace."
"2","a brilliant, well-written economics primer","Hazlitt presents a clear, concise lesson on basic economics. His message is well-articulated and well-supported. This is a must read for every person who has ever worked or voted (or is planning to do either) because it discusses the essentials in both economic theory and the politics that put the theory into practice.Unfortunately, there are some erroneous ideas in this book. Hazlitt occasionally makes claims or implies that the government should make some interventions into the economy; he also seems to think that capitalism's merit lies in its service to the ""common good."" However, these fallacies are rare, and they do not significantly detract from the book.For a great back-to-back lesson in economics and its moral base, read this book followed by CAPITALISM: THE UNKNOWN IDEAL by Ayn Rand."
"1","Don't waste your money.","If you are new to Economics, this is one book that you can skip. It is not useful nor ""mandatory reading"" if you are looking to understand the subject better. There is not even one chart or graph included in this book!!! Stick with Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science or Economics for Dummies as these two titles will serve you better."
"1","More of a personal opinion than that of economics","When I read something I like the whole story with some facts to back them up, but what I got out of this book was a guy with one side of politics while giving his opinion. Although many of his policies I tend to agree with, I just have a really hard time reading something when the entire book (well, I only got around a third way through it) is swung in one way direction. If you like reading about someone's opinion then you'll love this book, but if you're like me and just like cold hard facts leaving it up to yourself at making your own opinion, then don't buy this book."
"1","Not what it claims to Be","I was actually looking for a book on economics... This book is more of a conservative rant. It's not so much that I disagree with what he says so much as the fact that its all politics and very little economics. Buy this book if you want to hear how much the author thinks liberalism stinks... not if you want ""Economics in one lesson."" I definitely feel like I got tricked into buying it."
"2","The best book on Economics...","...I have ever read.Excellent read for the layperson. Most relevant to our current economic crisis in America. Every politician should be required to read this book. In fact, every classroom teacher should read it, as well. Explains the mess our government has created and why its continued destructive policies are leading our country to assured economic collapse. Policies based entirely on fallacies!!"
"2","3.5 Stars-A useful supplementary text for lower division microeconomic principles courses only","This book is useful for teaching lower division undergraduate students the principles of microeconomics.It can be used as a supplementary book.Hazlitt emphasizes the important concept of opportunity cost,but neglects to incorporate any discussion of spillover effects and externalities(positive and negative,depletable and undepletable),market failure,public goods,the theory of second best,adverse selection,moral hazard, the principal-agent problem,etc.It is interesting that all these missing topics were originally covered by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations(1776),especially in Part V."
"1","Title is a Scam","When someone is intentionally deceptive in order to sell books or to capture an audience this lowers the value of what they have to say to absolute zero."
"1","NO Help","This book did not help me with my economics class. Even though I passed the course with a B. This book reads more like a novel and really does not simplify economics at all. I work better with definitions and examples and this book gives none."
"1","Polemic and Outdated","I read this in the 1980's, and it was a non-event back then. Like most books that claim to have ""the answer,"" this book gives an enormously over-simplified view of economics that does not reflect the real world. Moreover, it presents as settled many open questions, claiming the authors opinions as facts. There are many better books on free-market economics, and far, far better books on economics in general."
"1","Too simplistic","Although though we're (presumably) members of the same political choir, the author treats economics much too simplistically.Calling this book a polemic on Keynesian economics would be accurate, calling it an economics treatise would be just plain wrong.Time would be better spent reading Bastiat."
"1","This ain't no economics book!","I was expecting a book on economics 101, so maybe I might understand market forces, PE ratios, stuff like that.It's just a big argument for a libertarian government. Not even particularly good arguments either - they're all based on metaphors, like the broken window (paraphrased from memory):'Even though they may get paid, a community does not get rich fixing broken windows. That holds the community still, it does not push it forward.'That's a fine argument and all, but that's not teaching. Metaphors are mental manipulation... give me all the pros and cons and let me decide. Or better: give me the damn facts.And it's outdated too. The book is 50 years old. We are so NOT in Post WWII economics."
"1","No lessons learned","This is one of the most disappointing purchases I have made on Amazon.The book is one long, myopic, libertarian apology."
"2","Best book on Economics for the general reader","This is an excellent introduction to Economics. Hazlitt was a clear writer, and his analysis of fallacious economic thought is very informative. You don't have to be a student of Economics - this is a book that can benefit every reader. I just wish more of our politicians had read this book."
"2","If you don't have this, get it!","This book is a wonderful illustration of the simple (so simple they go unnoticed) principles of a market economy and the many fallacies of adding socialism to the mix.I could have easily given this 4.5 stars, but I didn't have the option. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 was that Hazlitt partially caves in about halfway through the book on the topic of unions. Unions are tantamount to coersion and have no place in a market economy."
"2","Read the angry anti-Hazlitt reviews for a real indication","I think beyond the fact that Hazlitt produces a succinct and well-argued explanation for why free markets are the best arrangements in economic relationships, what is really wonderful is reading the screeds of those readers that he pisses off! Read the rabid ranting temper tantrum of the one reader who amazingly was accepted to the University of Chicago and you can see how ideas that actually support free thought and productive profitable endeavors drive lunatics like this crazy - its awesome!! This dork probably marches against the WTO."
"2","Give this book to a your children.","Economics in One Lesson elucidates the basic principles of Economics in a simple, understandable language. If you are just starting out on economics, I would recommend this as your first book. College Textbooks will bore you and treatise like Human Action by L.W. Mises are pretty hard for a beginner.Also, be sure to give this book to your children. Schools don't teach economics, a most important of subjects.With that said, I would like to comment on many 1 star reviews. Notice how they don't comment on the content of the book. Economics is a Science, and it is better to put away your Political Glasses when studying it."
"2","ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON","Economics in One Lesson is another great ""must read"" book. Like Bastiat's ""The Law,"" it is short and sweet. At the same time, it clearly explains the basic fundamentals of economics.Considering the stupid and abusive actions that are rampant in Congress, state legislatures, county commissions and city councils, the overwhelming majority of these so-called 'leaders' are utterly ignorant.Don't you be one of them.Buy and read Economics in One Lesson.Then call up your politicians and give them an earful."
"2","Never more needed than today","Sure, a few of the specific examples cited 60+ years ago are no longer relevant today, but the basic lessons are absolutely and permanently valid and need more than ever to be understood by at least a majority of the voting public.The sad fact is that Americans can go through the entire public school system and ""higher education"" without learning the first thing about economic science (while getting bombarded with self-serving economic propaganda). Thus public gullibility to the fallacies cited by Hazlitt seems no less pervasive now than back then, while the resultant cancerous growth of government economic meddling has only increased.Here's a revolutionary fantasy: Make this book a required study by all high school students. Imagine what that would do for the kinds of politicians who get elected in the future.BTW, you can get the nice hard-cover edition at less cost directly from the Mises Institute."
